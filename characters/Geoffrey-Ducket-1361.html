<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Geoffrey Ducket is a foundling who rises from abandonment during the plague to become a prosperous London merchant. Raised in the household of merchant <a href="characters/Gilbert-Bull-1330.html">Gilbert Bull</a> on London Bridge, apprenticed to grocer <a href="characters/John-Fleming-1341.html">John Fleming</a>, and mentored by the young <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Whittington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Whittington</a>, Geoffrey's life embodies the social mobility possible in medieval London's merchant class. His defining characteristics – resilience, loyalty, and courage – are tested during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, when a case of mistaken identity nearly destroys his prospects. He ultimately marries his childhood companion Tiffany Bull, inherits considerable wealth, and establishes his own heraldic legacy with a coat of arms featuring ducks in honor of his humble origins.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Geoffrey is easily identified by two distinctive hereditary features: a white patch in his brown hair and webbed skin between his fingers. These unusual traits mark him as a member of the Ducket family, though his exact parentage remains unknown. During the Peasants' Revolt, he suffers burns to his hands while rescuing <a href="characters/Ben-Carpenter-1362.html">Ben Carpenter</a> from the burning Savoy Palace. He is described as strong, cheerful in appearance, and possessed of a resilient spirit that allows him to recover quickly from setbacks.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Geoffrey Ducket's most defining trait is his extraordinary resilience. Richard Whittington observed early on that "no matter how often he goes down, he gets back up again. He never gives up." This quality serves him throughout his life, from enduring his uncertain status as a foundling to recovering from false accusations and social disgrace.</p>

<p>He possesses an innate cheerfulness and optimistic spirit despite his humble origins and uncertain place in the world. As a child, he maintained this sunny disposition even while grappling with his identity as neither family member nor servant in the Bull household. His curiosity leads him to explore London's workshops and trades with genuine enthusiasm, and he approaches his apprenticeship in the grocery trade with dedication and passion.</p>

<p>Geoffrey demonstrates remarkable courage and loyalty. He risks his life to save Ben Carpenter from the burning Savoy Palace during the Peasants' Revolt, suffering burns in the process. When he discovers that <a href="characters/Benedict-Silversleeves-1352.html">Benedict Silversleeves</a> has defrauded his master Fleming and intends to marry Tiffany under false pretenses, he confronts Silversleeves despite knowing it will cost him everything.</p>

<p>His character combines street-smart practicality with genuine decency. Unlike Dame Barnikel who schemes for him to marry Amy Fleming for the George Inn, or his wife Tiffany who later manipulates her father's love life to protect their inheritance, Geoffrey operates more directly and honestly. He tells Tiffany he would "die for her" and means it literally, later proving his devotion by confronting a would-be murderer on her behalf.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1361-birth-and-abandonment'>1361: Birth and Abandonment</h3>

<p>Geoffrey is born into the Ducket family in London, but during the plague that sweeps the city, his entire family dies. As a baby, he is left by London Bridge to be found and taken in by charitable citizens. He is discovered and brought to the household of merchant Gilbert Bull on London Bridge. Since babies could not enter heaven unbaptized and no record of his christening can be found at local churches, he is baptized and given the name Geoffrey in honor of Bull's friend, the courtier Geoffrey Chaucer, who becomes his godfather.</p>

<h3 id='1361-1368-early-childhood-in-the-bull-household'>1361-1368: Early Childhood in the Bull Household</h3>

<p>Geoffrey grows up in the Bull household on London Bridge, neither quite family nor servant. At age five, when Tiffany Bull is born, Gilbert Bull tells him plainly: "Your name is Ducket. Ours is Bull." This is the moment young Geoffrey understands he is not truly part of the family. He lives in the attic with the servants and apprentices, though his favorite place is the busy kitchen where he watches the cook work with the great spit, the iron kettle, the leather tank of live fish from the Thames, and the spice cupboard.</p>

<p>During these years, he forms two crucial relationships. The first is with Richard Whittington, an apprentice in the Bull household about ten years older than Geoffrey. Whittington takes a liking to the foundling, teaching him to wrestle and box, and showing him London's sights – the Guildhall, the Mercers' Guild hall on Cheapside, St Paul's Cathedral. Geoffrey looks up to Whittington as a hero and absorbs his ambition to join London's merchant elite. The second relationship is with a fat kitchen girl named Ducket, whom he hopefully asks if she is family, but she does not know.</p>

<h3 id='1368-school-at-st-mary-le-bow'>1368: School at St Mary-le-Bow</h3>

<p>At age seven, Geoffrey is sent to school at St Mary-le-Bow, where he learns to read and write Latin, though classes are now conducted in the newly fashionable English rather than Latin and birch rod that characterized Gilbert Bull's generation.</p>

<h3 id='1369-1373-growing-up-with-tiffany'>1369-1373: Growing Up with Tiffany</h3>

<p>As Tiffany grows from infant to young girl, Geoffrey becomes her companion, remembering Whittington's kindness to him and trying to be kind to her in turn. They fish for trout and salmon in the Thames together, and he looks after her with genuine affection. One memorable day, when Geoffrey is eleven, they watch from the big upstairs window as Whittington shoots London Bridge – navigating his boat through the dangerous arch in the racing waters below – and waves his blue neckerchief in triumph. Tiffany asks Geoffrey if he would do it for her, and he promises he would.</p>

<h3 id='1373-apprenticeship-decision'>1373: Apprenticeship Decision</h3>

<p>At age twelve, Gilbert Bull summons Geoffrey to discuss his future apprenticeship. Geoffrey initially hopes to become a mercer like Bull and Whittington, but Bull explains bluntly that mercers need money and connections: "You've no money, you see. You must learn a craft." Geoffrey cheerfully explores London's workshops – glovers, saddlers, lorimers, coopers, cordwainers, weavers, bakers, butchers. While walking with young Tiffany near Charing Cross discussing the merits of being a butcher versus a bowyer, they encounter Geoffrey Chaucer, his godfather, who arranges for Geoffrey to be apprenticed to John Fleming, a modest grocer with a stall in the West Cheap and a home in Southwark.</p>

<h3 id='1373-1381-apprenticeship-to-john-fleming'>1373-1381: Apprenticeship to John Fleming</h3>

<p>Geoffrey moves into Fleming's household at the George Inn in Southwark, run by Fleming's formidable wife Dame Barnikel. Every morning, he and Fleming push their brightly painted handcart across London Bridge to their stall in West Cheap by Honey Lane, keeping their goods in a storehouse behind the George. At day's end, Geoffrey locks their modest takings in a strongbox kept under the floor of the store.</p>

<p>Geoffrey loves the grocery trade. He learns to identify every item by smell – nutmeg, cinnamon, saffron, cloves, sage, rosemary, garlic, thyme, hazelnuts, walnuts, chestnuts, salt, dried fruit, and especially the valuable black peppercorns that Fleming calls "the grocer's gold dust, young Geoffrey Ducket. Purest gold." Fleming is scrupulously honest, weighing every item with utmost care, boasting he's never been taken to the Pie-Powder court in his life.</p>

<p>Geoffrey befriends Fleming's daughter <a href="characters/Amy-Fleming-1365.html">Amy Fleming</a> and craftsman Ben Carpenter, often walking out to Clapham or Battersea with them. Dame Barnikel, however, has other plans, telling Geoffrey directly that successful apprentices "marry the master's daughter" and ordering him to win Amy away from Carpenter. Geoffrey continues to visit Tiffany every week during this period.</p>

<p>In 1376, Geoffrey attends Tiffany's eleventh birthday celebration, where she is dressed as a grown-up for the first time and meets Benedict Silversleeves, a clever young lawyer who makes a great impression on her family with an astrolabe demonstration. Whittington, now a successful mercer, tells Geoffrey bluntly, "I hate that fellow."</p>

<h3 id='1381-the-peasants-revolt-and-false-accusation'>1381: The Peasants' Revolt and False Accusation</h3>

<p>In spring 1381, as discontent over the poll tax spreads through the countryside, Geoffrey hears reports of trouble but thinks little of it. In early June, news arrives that Wat Tyler is leading Kent men toward London, and Essex men are massing on the other side of the Thames. When Amy Fleming begs Geoffrey to find Ben Carpenter, fearing he has joined the rebels at Blackheath, Geoffrey walks out to the great camp.</p>

<p>At Blackheath, Geoffrey finds tens of thousands of peasants gathered. He locates Carpenter and spends the evening and night with the rebels, listening to John Ball preach radical reform and watching the camp's mood. The next day, he witnesses King Richard II's barge approach at Greenwich, though the king's council refuses to let him land among the rebels. When the rebels finally enter London on Friday, June 14, Geoffrey is swept along in the crowd as they march to the Savoy Palace, John of Gaunt's residence.</p>

<p>As the Savoy burns, Geoffrey watches in fascination and sadness. When he turns back from observing the burning Temple, he discovers Carpenter has vanished. He spots the craftsman walking into the burning Savoy courtyard "as though in a dream," drawn by the flames. Geoffrey's instinctive heroism takes over – he runs in and drags Carpenter to safety, but is badly burned in the process, particularly his hands. He takes Carpenter to St Bartholomew's Hospital and heads toward the George to tell Amy what happened.</p>

<p>Near London Bridge, Geoffrey is spotted by James Bull, a kinsman of Gilbert Bull who has been trying to impress his rich cousin by capturing looters from the Savoy. James sees Geoffrey's white patch and burned hands, tackles him, and drags him before Gilbert Bull with the accusation: "This fellow was looting the Savoy." Bull, believing his former ward has become a rebel and looter, locks Geoffrey in the kitchen of his house as a prisoner.</p>

<p>Geoffrey spends a terrifying night locked up, hearing the sounds of continued violence in the city. The next morning, Saturday, the noise changes – cheers and laughter instead of threats. Bull appears and announces coldly: "It seems the king has pardoned you." Wat Tyler has been killed at Smithfield, the revolt has collapsed, and King Richard has issued a general pardon. But Bull's heart remains hard: "He was with the rebels; that is enough. He is a traitor." He releases Geoffrey but forbids him from ever coming to the house again, declaring he will honor his commitments for the apprenticeship but nothing more. One month later, Benedict Silversleeves and Tiffany Bull are betrothed.</p>

<h3 id='1382-the-silversleeves-conspiracy-exposed'>1382: The Silversleeves Conspiracy Exposed</h3>

<p>The following spring, Geoffrey begins to suspect something is wrong when Fleming seems increasingly subdued and worried, though Geoffrey knows nothing of his master's ruinous addiction to alchemy. In May 1382, a mysterious earthquake strikes London. That same day, Benedict Silversleeves visits Fleming's store and later tries to murder Geoffrey, stabbing him outside St Paul's. Geoffrey fights off his attacker in the dark and recognizes him as Silversleeves. Gravely wounded but alive, Geoffrey realizes Silversleeves must be responsible for Fleming's troubles.</p>

<p>Geoffrey discovers the truth: Silversleeves has been defrauding Fleming through a fake alchemy scheme, stealing money from the strongbox Geoffrey locks each night, and has driven Fleming to financial ruin. When Fleming is accused of theft by Dame Barnikel, the shame is so great that Fleming hangs himself in the storeroom. Before dying, Fleming writes a note urging his family to trust Geoffrey Ducket to take over the business.</p>

<p>Geoffrey visits Tiffany to warn her about Silversleeves, knowing he has no proof and that she is weeks away from marriage to the lawyer. She is torn, unable to believe his accusations against the man her family has embraced. The situation seems hopeless – Fleming is dead, Silversleeves is about to marry Tiffany, and Geoffrey has lost everything.</p>

<p>The crisis reaches its climax when Geoffrey encounters Silversleeves near the bridge and, after a violent confrontation, nearly throws him over the side. Just as Silversleeves is about to fall to his death, he confesses everything to save his life – the alchemy fraud, the theft, driving Fleming to suicide. Tiffany, who had been walking toward them, overhears the entire confession. When Silversleeves claims she didn't hear it, Tiffany steps forward and tells Geoffrey: "I heard every word."</p>

<p>Gilbert Bull, confronted with the truth, makes a complete reversal. He apologizes unreservedly to Geoffrey for doubting his character, acknowledges that Tiffany's judgment is better than his own, and asks Geoffrey if he would consider marrying his daughter. Geoffrey and Tiffany marry a week later, with Whittington standing beside the bridegroom and Chaucer making a speech.</p>

<p>Bull makes one stipulation: since he has no son and Geoffrey will inherit a large fortune, Geoffrey must take the name Bull. Geoffrey and Tiffany readily agree and become Geoffrey and Tiffany Bull, moving into a pleasant house on Oyster Hill by London Bridge.</p>

<h3 id='1382-1395-prosperity-and-a-name-restored'>1382-1395: Prosperity and a Name Restored</h3>

<p>Over the next thirteen years, Geoffrey prospers considerably, becoming an officer of the Grocers Guild and a ward counsellor – achievements unusual for someone so young and of such humble origins. He visits the College of Arms to establish a coat of arms. When the Earl Marshal expresses surprise at his youth for such a dignity, Geoffrey admits he married Bull's daughter and advanced because of it, acknowledging his humble birth. He works with a clerk to design arms that honor his origins: a silver shield with two wavy blue bars representing the Thames, and three red ducks. The heraldic description is "Argent, two Bars Wavy Azure, between three Ducks Gules."</p>

<p>Around 1390, however, Geoffrey and Tiffany quietly change their name back to Ducket. When Gilbert Bull discovers this – learning from his own cook that she refers to Geoffrey as "Master Ducket" not "Master Bull" – he flies into a towering rage, accusing them of treachery and bad blood. "It's the fortune of Bull you expect to inherit, not of Ducket," he roars. Bull refuses to change his will back and declares his intention to marry again and have a son who will inherit instead.</p>

<p>Tiffany, revealing a calculating side Geoffrey has never seen before, orchestrates a solution. She and Dame Barnikel approach women throughout London to find Bull a companion who either cannot marry him (because she's already married) or cannot bear children. Richard Whittington assists by inviting Bull to a feast and seating him next to Sister Olive, a nun from St Helen's convent and a distant kinswoman of Tiffany's mother. Bull begins an affair with Sister Olive that lasts eight years and ends his interest in remarriage.</p>

<h3 id='1395-1422-inheritance-and-legacy'>1395-1422: Inheritance and Legacy</h3>

<p>In 1395, when both the heir to Bocton and then Gilbert Bull's brother die, Bull inherits the lovely Kent estate and becomes the richest member of his family who had ever lived. He moves to Bocton, and Geoffrey and Tiffany take over the house on London Bridge. Bull's anger over the name change gradually softens as he sees his seven healthy grandchildren. A herald at the College of Arms explains that since Geoffrey has his own arms and Tiffany is an armorial heiress, the arms of Bull and Ducket can be joined, giving Bull heraldic immortality. From Bocton, Bull looks out across the Weald of Kent and finds his retirement years "bathed in a soft and gentle light."</p>

<p>In 1400, plague returns to London. Bull takes his family to safety at Bocton, but Geoffrey Chaucer, Geoffrey's beloved godfather, dies in his house at Westminster – whether from plague or something else is unclear. Bull bitterly regrets not bringing Chaucer to safety at Bocton.</p>

<p>By 1422, it is generally agreed in London that few families are more fortunate than that of Ducket. Geoffrey and Tiffany have seven healthy children, Geoffrey has continued to increase his considerable fortune, and Tiffany has become a far greater heiress than she ever hoped, inheriting the Bocton estate and Bull's vast wealth.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='richard-whittington'>Richard Whittington</h3>

<p>Whittington serves as Geoffrey's hero and mentor during childhood. The apprentice ten years his senior teaches him to wrestle and box, shows him London, and recognizes his resilient character. Whittington's influence shapes Geoffrey's aspirations to join London's merchant elite. Later, as a successful mercer and eventually mayor of London, Whittington stands beside Geoffrey at his wedding and helps orchestrate the solution to Bull's remarriage problem. Their relationship represents the bonds formed across social classes in London's guild system.</p>

<h3 id='gilbert-bull'>Gilbert Bull</h3>

<p>Bull is Geoffrey's reluctant benefactor – taking in the plague orphan but making clear he is not family. Bull provides for Geoffrey's upbringing and education but expects him to know his place. When Geoffrey is falsely accused during the Peasants' Revolt, Bull's quick judgment and class prejudices lead him to believe the worst: "Never trust a foundling. Bad blood." Only when confronted with overwhelming evidence does Bull acknowledge his error and apologize unreservedly. After Geoffrey and Tiffany revert to the Ducket name, Bull's fury reveals his deep investment in family legacy and name, though he ultimately reconciles with them. Bull represents the rigid social hierarchies Geoffrey must navigate.</p>

<h3 id='tiffany-bull'>Tiffany Bull</h3>

<p>Geoffrey and Tiffany grow up together, with Geoffrey acting as protective older brother to the merchant's daughter five years younger. He promises her as a child that he would shoot London Bridge for her, and later promises he would "die for her." Their relationship transforms from childhood companionship to desperate adult love when Geoffrey risks everything to save her from Silversleeves. Tiffany's faith in Geoffrey, despite all evidence against him and social pressure to marry well, demonstrates her strength of character. After marriage, Geoffrey discovers Tiffany has a calculating, strategic side he never suspected – she manipulates her father's love life to protect their inheritance with cool determination. Their partnership combines genuine affection with pragmatic alliance.</p>

<h3 id='john-fleming'>John Fleming</h3>

<p>Fleming is Geoffrey's master and a formative influence. The modest, scrupulously honest grocer teaches Geoffrey the trade and treats him with kindness, though his sad, thin face and philosophical nature contrast with Geoffrey's cheerfulness. Fleming's hidden vice – addiction to Silversleeves's alchemy fraud – leads to his ruin and suicide, but his final act is to write a note urging his family to trust Geoffrey. Fleming represents the vulnerability of honest men to clever predators.</p>

<h3 id='benedict-silversleeves'>Benedict Silversleeves</h3>

<p>Silversleeves is Geoffrey's nemesis – clever, pious in appearance, but utterly ruthless underneath. He defrauds Fleming, attempts to murder Geoffrey, and would have married Tiffany under false pretenses if not exposed. Geoffrey's confrontation with Silversleeves tests everything he is: his courage, his commitment to truth, and his willingness to sacrifice his own prospects to save those he loves. When Geoffrey has Silversleeves hanging over the side of the bridge, about to fall to his death, Silversleeves's terrified confession reveals the truth Geoffrey alone has believed.</p>

<h3 id='geoffrey-chaucer'>Geoffrey Chaucer</h3>

<p>Chaucer serves as godfather and occasional guardian angel. He arranges Geoffrey's apprenticeship to Fleming when Bull cannot imagine the foundling becoming a mercer. Chaucer persuades Bull to settle money on Geoffrey so he can take over Fleming's business or start his own. As a courtier moving in high circles – he marries into the Plantagenet royal house through his wife's sister Katherine, mistress to John of Gaunt – Chaucer represents the possibility of rising through talent rather than birth. His death in the plague of 1400 is one of Geoffrey's great losses.</p>

<h3 id='ben-carpenter-and-amy-fleming'>Ben Carpenter and Amy Fleming</h3>

<p>Geoffrey befriends both during his apprenticeship. He saves Carpenter's life by dragging him from the burning Savoy, an act that ironically leads to his own false accusation as a rebel. Geoffrey's heroism toward Carpenter, despite having no obligation and considerable risk, demonstrates his fundamental decency. His relationship with Amy is friendly but never romantic, despite Dame Barnikel's scheming – Geoffrey's heart belongs to Tiffany.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Geoffrey Ducket's life spans one of medieval London's most turbulent periods (1361-after 1422), encompassing plague, social upheaval, political crisis, and economic transformation.</p>

<p>Born during the continuing waves of plague that followed the Black Death of 1348-49, Geoffrey is orphaned by disease that repeatedly devastated London's population. His survival as an abandoned infant and his upbringing in a merchant household reflect the social fluidity created by plague's demographic catastrophe – traditional family structures collapsed, creating opportunities for the survival and advancement of orphans who might not have existed in more stable times.</p>

<p>The Peasants' Revolt of 1381, the most dramatic event of Geoffrey's youth, erupts from tensions over labor shortages (caused by plague), new taxation, and conflicts between old feudal obligations and new economic realities. Geoffrey witnesses the revolt from an unusual perspective – neither noble nor peasant, but a young London apprentice who accidentally finds himself among the rebels. His false accusation and pardon reflect the chaos and rough justice of those days, when ordinary Londoners could be swept up in historical events beyond their control.</p>

<p>Geoffrey's career as a grocer places him in one of London's great livery companies, guilds that dominated the city's economic and political life. The Grocers Guild (formed from the merger of Pepperers and "grossers") vied with Fishmongers, Mercers, and Wool merchants for the city's greatest offices. Geoffrey's rapid rise to guild officer and ward counsellor, despite his humble origins, demonstrates London's meritocratic potential – in the city, wealth and guild membership mattered more than birth, though the prejudices Geoffrey faces from Bull show that birth was never entirely irrelevant.</p>

<p>His connection to Geoffrey Chaucer, Richard Whittington, and the court of Richard II places him at the intersection of London's merchant elite and royal politics. The deposition of Richard II in 1399 and the rise of Henry IV represents the kind of disruption to proper order that troubled men like Gilbert Bull. Geoffrey lives through the reigns of Edward III, Richard II, Henry IV, and Henry V – seeing England's victories in France, the young king's brave handling of the Peasants' Revolt, and the constitutional conflicts between crown, nobility, and commons that characterized this era.</p>

<p>The creation of Geoffrey's coat of arms reflects the rising status of London merchants. By the late 14th century, successful guild members and city officials could legitimately claim arms, joining the ranks of the gentry. Geoffrey's choice of ducks – honestly representing his name and humble origins rather than adopting grand heraldic monsters – shows both pride and self-awareness.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Geoffrey Ducket embodies several of the novel's central themes about London and English history.</p>

<p><strong>Social Mobility and Identity</strong>: Geoffrey's journey from foundling to armigerous merchant illustrates London's unique capacity for social transformation. Unlike the rigid hierarchies of the countryside, the city offers paths to prosperity through guild membership, apprenticeship, and strategic marriage. Yet Geoffrey never entirely escapes questions of identity and belonging – Bull's reminder "Your name is Ducket. Ours is Bull" shadows him until he chooses to reclaim his birth name. His white patch and webbed fingers mark him always as different, making his identity visible and inescapable. The tension between his adopted identity (Bull) and his birth identity (Ducket) reflects broader questions about how individuals relate to family, name, and social position.</p>

<p><strong>Resilience and Character</strong>: Geoffrey's defining trait – getting back up no matter how often he's knocked down – represents a particularly urban form of survival. Unlike the agricultural patience of peasants or the inherited authority of nobles, Geoffrey's success comes from an almost entrepreneurial resilience: learning new trades, adapting to circumstances, surviving false accusations, and rebuilding when necessary. Whittington recognizes this quality early, and it proves more valuable than birth or wealth.</p>

<p><strong>The Power of Reputation and False Judgment</strong>: The false accusation during the Peasants' Revolt nearly destroys Geoffrey's prospects, showing how fragile reputation could be in a society where social position depended on trust and good name. Bull's willingness to believe the worst about Geoffrey – despite years of knowing him – reveals how prejudices about birth ("Never trust a foundling. Bad blood") can override evidence and personal knowledge. Geoffrey's eventual vindication comes only through dramatic circumstances, suggesting how difficult it was to overcome false judgments once made.</p>

<p><strong>London versus the Countryside</strong>: Geoffrey's accidental involvement in the Peasants' Revolt illuminates the divide between London's urban culture and the countryside's different conception of order and freedom. As Geoffrey observes at Blackheath, the peasants dream of being free farmers like Anglo-Saxons of old, while Londoners understand freedom in terms of guild membership, city walls, and chartered liberties. Geoffrey is fundamentally a Londoner – his identity is inseparable from the city's rhythms, its markets, its social structures.</p>

<p><strong>Marriage and Alliance</strong>: Geoffrey's marriage to Tiffany represents both romantic love and pragmatic alliance, showing how medieval marriages served multiple purposes. Their childhood companionship blossoms into devotion tested by adversity, but their marriage also secures Geoffrey's fortune and Tiffany's choice of husband. Tiffany's later maneuvering to protect their inheritance reveals that successful marriages required not just affection but strategic thinking about wealth and family interests.</p>

<p><strong>Legacy and Name</strong>: The conflict over Geoffrey taking and then abandoning the Bull name explores questions of family legacy, inheritance, and identity. Bull's fury at Geoffrey reclaiming the Ducket name shows how deeply medieval people invested in family name as a form of immortality. Geoffrey's solution – heraldic arms that can be joined with Bull's – offers a compromise: the Ducket name survives while honoring Bull's lineage. His choice of ducks for his coat of arms rather than impressive heraldic monsters shows a craftsman's honesty about origins and a modern sensibility about authentic identity.</p>

<p><strong>Fortune and Merit</strong>: Geoffrey's story suggests that success requires both personal merit (resilience, skill, courage) and fortune (Chaucer's intervention, Whittington's friendship, Tiffany's love, Silversleeves's confession at the crucial moment). His rise cannot be attributed entirely to either individual virtue or lucky circumstances – both are necessary. This reflects the novel's realistic view of how people actually advance in society.</p>
