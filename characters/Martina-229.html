<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Martina is a striking young woman of mixed African and European descent living in Roman Londinium in AD 251. Married at sixteen to a master mariner thirty-four years her senior, she finds herself trapped in a loveless marriage that offers security but no fulfillment. Her decision to engage in an affair becomes the catalyst for a dramatic sequence of events involving theft, murder, and betrayal, ultimately leading to her freedom and remarriage to her young lover <a href="characters/Julius-231.html">Julius</a>.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Martina is described as unusually striking in appearance. She is twenty-two years old, almost as tall as Julius, with pale skin and yellow hair that grows in tight curls close to her head. Her hair and slightly broadened nose reveal her African heritage – her grandmother was brought as a slave to Gaul from the African province of Numidia. She has small, very white teeth that are rather uneven, and blue eyes shaped like large, rounded almonds with a strange, smoky quality. Her slim body moves with a wonderful, rhythmic grace that sets her apart from other women of the port. This distinctive beauty and graceful movement make her memorable to those who see her.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Martina is a woman caught between loneliness and desire, trapped in circumstances that offer material security at the cost of emotional fulfillment. She possesses a contemplative nature, often taking solitary walks and seeking comfort in prayer at various shrines. Her melancholy is reflected in her connection to physical structures – the bridge's "long, dark form" reminds her of her own "lonely journey through life."</p>

<p>Despite her sadness, Martina has an inner strength and cunning. When she decides to pursue an affair with Julius, she demonstrates tactical skill in playing off his interest against that of Sextus, "first advancing then pretending to withdraw." She takes pleasure in the game of seduction, finding excitement even in the planning. Her sensuality is evident in her careful preparations for the rendezvous – brushing her hair, washing and scenting herself, even ensuring her new sandals would give off an appealing smell.</p>

<p>Martina is pragmatic about her circumstances. She understands she should not complain about her marriage – the mariner is never cruel and provides well for her. Yet she eventually recognizes with "terrible, absolute clarity" that her life has become a prison. This self-awareness drives her to risk everything for a chance at happiness, showing both courage and recklessness.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-marriage-c-229-247'>Early Life and Marriage (c. 229-247)</h3>

<p>Martina's early life was marked by loss. Her parents died, leaving her alone in the world in Gaul. At sixteen, she met a master mariner, a widower of fifty with grown children, who had recently moved from Gaul to Londinium. He offered her "a new life, a home and security," and she married him, grateful for the opportunity.</p>

<h3 id='life-in-londinium-247-251'>Life in Londinium (247-251)</h3>

<p>The mariner proudly showed Martina the city when they arrived. She was particularly impressed by the long line of oak wharves, the vast basilica ("the biggest in northern Europe"), the Governor's Palace, public baths, temples, and the great amphitheatre. She came to love Londinium and felt herself part of the great classical culture of Rome.</p>

<p>The mariner's trade was prosperous, sailing to Gaul with British pottery and returning with red Samian bowls, wine, olive oil, and dates. He sometimes exported oysters from the estuary beds. They lived well in a house in the city's southern annexe, across the bridge from the main city.</p>

<p>When her husband was away on voyages, Martina took solitary walks – to the island by the ford where a villa now stood, to the marble arch at the great crossroads two miles from the upper western gate, or to the southern ridges to admire the view. She prayed frequently at various shrines, desperately hoping for a child. She tried the Celtic mother goddess shrines and found particular comfort at a sacred well outside the lower western gate, where a Celtic water goddess dwelt. But no child came.</p>

<h3 id='recognition-of-unhappiness-spring-251'>Recognition of Unhappiness (Spring 251)</h3>

<p>One day that spring, while watching workmen build a revetment along the riverbank, Martina had a revelation. A workman explained they were taking land back from the river: "It's like a woman, you see. We use the river and we tame her." This comparison struck Martina deeply. She realized the mariner used her similarly – he had "an obedient young wife to look after him whenever he came to port." Though he was "fairly" kind and never cruel, she understood she should not complain.</p>

<p>Walking to the eastern corner where the city wall met the river, Martina stood alone gazing at the impressive twenty-foot-high wall with its red tile stripes. In that moment, it came to her "with terrible, absolute clarity that she was not happy and that, after all, her life had become a prison."</p>

<h3 id='the-affairs-summer-251'>The Affairs (Summer 251)</h3>

<p>Around this time, Sextus, a carpenter and counterfeiter, began pursuing Martina. Though initially repelled, his advances made her think. She knew other women with older husbands who took lovers. "As Sextus persisted, something in her began to stir."</p>

<p>But it was Julius who truly captured her interest. She was drawn to "his boyish looks, his bright blue eyes and obvious physical prowess," as well as "the faint briny smell of him, the way his powerful young shoulders bent to his work and the sweat glistened on his arms." Once she allowed the idea to take hold, she "found an almost aching desire to have him possess her."</p>

<p>Martina cunningly teased Julius, squeezing his hand when parting, deliberately brushing against him at the quay, and remarking that "Every girl likes to get a present." She played the two men against each other, flirting mildly with Sextus while drawing Julius in.</p>

<p>When Julius sent her a letter asking her to meet him at the bridge during the games with a promise of a present, Martina prepared herself carefully. She stood at the bridge at sunset, reading the letter and feeling "a little tremble go down her body." The evening's "faint, sensuous melancholy" worked upon her, and she decided: "I can't be sad any more."</p>

<h3 id='the-rendezvous-and-betrayal'>The Rendezvous and Betrayal</h3>

<p>On the day of the games, Martina rose early and prepared herself meticulously. She "brushed her short hair, washed and scented herself carefully," inspected her body, and put on new sandals whose leather would give off an appealing smell. She went to the bridge at noon as planned.</p>

<p>But Julius never appeared. He had become distracted pursuing a stolen cache of gold coins. Martina waited by the bridge for an hour, hearing the distant roars from the amphitheatre. She was "furious, as only a young woman can be who, having prepared herself to be kissed, finds herself ignored instead." She had taken a great risk and was now "humiliated and frustrated."</p>

<p>In this receptive state, when Sextus emerged from a side street and approached her, "it was only natural that she should welcome him now with a kiss." To ensure Julius would see if he was nearby, she kissed Sextus again.</p>

<h3 id='the-mariners-revenge'>The Mariner's Revenge</h3>

<p>Unknown to Martina, her husband had been suspicious for about a month, noticing "something in his young wife's manner; a preoccupied look; a tiny hesitation in their lovemaking." Though he had only just returned from a voyage, he had already been home and seen Julius's letter. That night, he waited for Sextus to arrive for his rendezvous with Martina, killed him, and disposed of the body.</p>

<p>The mariner's "first instinct was to punish her in a way she would not forget. In his mother's country she would have been stoned to death. But he was wiser than that." Recognizing he might not easily replace her, and having taken his revenge on her lover, he decided to treat her with kindness "and see what happened."</p>

<h3 id='new-beginning-252-253'>New Beginning (252-253)</h3>

<p>The mariner, "satisfied that he had dealt with his wife's lover," never suspected the affair that began between Julius and Martina the following spring. When the mariner was lost at sea a year later (c. 253), Julius not only took over his business but married Martina. They had at least two sons together, and Julius eventually became a full member of the Temple of Mithras.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='the-mariner'>The Mariner</h3>

<p>Martina's marriage to the mariner is defined by gratitude rather than love. She met him when she was alone in the world, and he offered her security and a new life. She describes being grateful, acknowledging "in a way she still was." The mariner is never cruel and provides well, taking her to Gaul for trade and keeping fine goods for their household.</p>

<p>However, the relationship is fundamentally unequal. He is thirty-four years older, and she serves primarily as "an obedient young wife to look after him whenever he came to port." Though he shows her the city proudly and is "fairly" kind, there is no deep emotional connection. Martina prays desperately for a child that never comes, suggesting either infertility or an unfulfilling sexual relationship.</p>

<p>The mariner proves more perceptive than Martina realizes. He notices subtle changes in her manner and eventually discovers her correspondence with Julius. His response reveals both his possessiveness and his pragmatism – he murders her lover but chooses not to punish her directly, calculating that he might not easily replace her.</p>

<h3 id='juliusjulius-231html'><a href="characters/Julius-231.html">Julius</a></h3>

<p>Martina's relationship with Julius begins as pure physical attraction. She is drawn to his youth, strength, and vitality – "the faint briny smell of him, the way his powerful young shoulders bent to his work and the sweat glistened on his arms." She desires to "take the bloom off his youth."</p>

<p>She pursues him with tactical skill, playing on his interest while keeping him uncertain. When he sends his letter, she feels triumphant: "I have him." Yet she also experiences real fear about the risks she is taking.</p>

<p>Though Julius fails to appear at their first rendezvous – becoming distracted by the prospect of stolen gold – their affair eventually begins the following spring. The relationship clearly develops beyond mere physical attraction, as they marry after the mariner's death and have children together. Their union proves lasting and apparently happy, suggesting that Martina found in Julius the emotional fulfillment she lacked with her first husband.</p>

<h3 id='sextus'>Sextus</h3>

<p>Martina's interaction with Sextus is primarily manipulative. Initially repelled by his advances, she uses him to make Julius jealous. She flirts with him mildly while pursuing Julius, creating competition between the two men. When Julius fails to appear at the bridge, her wounded pride leads her to kiss Sextus, attempting to make Julius jealous if he should see.</p>

<p>Ironically, it is Sextus rather than Julius who becomes the mariner's victim, murdered when he arrives for what he believes will be a rendezvous with Martina. She remains unaware that the mariner mistook Sextus for her true lover.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Martina's story unfolds in AD 251, during a period of relative peace in Roman Britain. Londinium has been standing for about two hundred years and has grown into a prosperous port city of perhaps twenty-five thousand people. The province offers a "haven of peace and modest prosperity" in contrast to the increasingly troubled world of the sprawling empire, where barbarians break through frontiers and political strife is endemic.</p>

<p>Her mixed heritage reflects the cosmopolitan nature of Roman Londinium. The port sees "Celts of all kinds, blond Germans, Latins, Greeks, Jews, and olive-skinned men from the Mediterranean's southern shores." Her African ancestry through her Numidian grandmother is unusual but not impossible in this diverse trading city. Slavery has brought people from across the empire to Britain.</p>

<p>Martina's literacy and her husband's literacy are unremarkable in Roman Londinium. "In the Roman city of Londinium, literacy was the norm. Though they usually spoke in Celtic, most townspeople knew Latin and could write it. Merchants wrote contracts, shopkeepers labelled goods, servants received written instructions and walls carried Latin graffiti." This allows her to receive and read Julius's love letter.</p>

<p>The religious landscape Martina navigates shows the syncretism of Roman Britain. She prays at shrines to Diana, Celtic mother goddesses, and a Celtic water goddess, moving freely between Roman and native British religious traditions. Her desperate prayers for a child reflect the importance of fertility and childbearing for women's status and security.</p>

<p>Martina's position as the wife of a prosperous merchant places her in comfortable circumstances but without the protection of family or children. As a woman alone in the world before her marriage, and childless within it, she is vulnerable. The mariner's calculation that he "might not find it so easy to replace her" and his decision not to punish her directly reflect both her value as a wife and her precarious position.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<h3 id='entrapment-and-freedom'>Entrapment and Freedom</h3>

<p>Martina embodies the theme of entrapment – both physical and emotional. Her revelation that the city wall, which she initially admired as a "splendid structure," has become a symbol of her life as "a prison" is central to her story. Like the river being "tamed" by the revetment, Martina has been tamed by her marriage. Her journey from passive acceptance to active pursuit of freedom, even at great risk, represents a fundamental human desire for fulfillment beyond mere security.</p>

<h3 id='desire-and-consequence'>Desire and Consequence</h3>

<p>Martina's story illustrates how desire can set in motion events with unforeseen consequences. Her decision to pursue an affair with Julius inadvertently leads to Sextus's death – the mariner mistakes Sextus for Julius when exacting revenge. Her wounded pride when Julius fails to appear leads her to kiss Sextus, reinforcing the mariner's mistaken belief. Yet this chain of misunderstandings ultimately leads to her freedom and happiness when the mariner is lost at sea, allowing her to marry Julius.</p>

<h3 id='the-loneliness-of-displacement'>The Loneliness of Displacement</h3>

<p>As someone alone in the world, orphaned and married to a much older man, Martina's experience reflects the isolation of displacement. Though she loves Londinium and feels herself part of Roman culture, her "lonely journey through life" continues. Her desperate prayers for a child at various shrines show her yearning for connection and belonging. Only when she finds love with Julius does she achieve the sense of home and family she has been seeking.</p>

<h3 id='female-agency-in-a-male-world'>Female Agency in a Male World</h3>

<p>Martina demonstrates agency within the constraints of her position. She cannot leave her marriage or support herself independently, but she can choose to pursue an affair. She deploys her sexuality and attractiveness strategically, manipulating the desires of multiple men. Yet the story also shows the limits of that agency – the mariner's power over her life is absolute, and only his death truly frees her. Her survival depends on his pragmatic decision not to punish her and the fortunate accident of his death at sea.</p>

<h3 id='love-and-pragmatism'>Love and Pragmatism</h3>

<p>Martina's two marriages contrast different motivations. Her first marriage is entirely pragmatic – she accepts the mariner's offer because she is alone and needs security. Her relationship with Julius begins with desire but develops into what appears to be genuine love and partnership. Yet even here, pragmatism plays a role – Julius takes over the mariner's business along with his widow, achieving both love and economic advancement. The story suggests that in the Roman world, love and practical considerations cannot be easily separated.</p>
