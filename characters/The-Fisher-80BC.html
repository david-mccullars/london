<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>The Fisher is a humble Celtic fisherman living by the Thames near Londinos in 54 BC. Known simply by his occupation rather than his given name, he is a devoted family man, skilled riverman, and gentle teacher to his son Segovax. Despite his physical frailty and curved spine, he demonstrates quiet determination and unexpected courage, choosing to honor an oath to the great chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassivellaunus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassivelaunus</a> even when it means certain death fighting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julius Caesar</a>'s invading Roman legions at the ford by Londinos.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>The Fisher has a distinctive appearance that marks his family line. His face is "scoured by crease lines almost resembling scales," giving him the look of "some solemn, fish-like creature." He has a curved back and long arms, with a thin face and rather straggly brown beard. Like his son Segovax, he bears a tuft of white hair on his forelock—a hereditary mark found in several families along the river. He also has webbed hands, with skin between the fingers extending to the first joint, an inherited trait that doesn't appear in every generation. His large eyes are soft and kindly. Though not physically imposing, his appearance reflects his connection to the river and his life as a fisherman.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>The Fisher embodies quiet strength and unwavering dedication. Though physically weaker than other men, with his curved back and thin frame, he never shrinks from his share of work. "He may not be much to look at," the hamlet men say, "but the Fisher never gives up." His determination compensates for his physical limitations, and he insists on working as hard as any man in communal labor, even when it leaves him pale and strained.</p>

<p>As a father, he is exceptionally devoted, patient, and loving. He takes great pleasure in teaching his children, spending countless hours with Segovax instructing him in fishing, hunting, thatching, lore, and the complex web of Celtic tribal relationships. His love for his family is profound—Segovax's mother "adored" him, and the feeling was mutual. Yet this devotion is balanced by a sense of duty that ultimately supersedes even family bonds.</p>

<p>The Fisher possesses deep knowledge of the river and its ways. His expertise with nets, understanding of tides and currents, and skill as a boatman make him invaluable to his community. He views the river with reverence, noting its tidal flow as "breathing," and teaches Segovax that "those who live here will never go hungry. The river always provides."</p>

<p>His character combines gentleness with surprising inner strength. Though kind and soft-spoken, he is capable of deep resolve. When it comes time to honor his oath to Cassivelaunus, he stands firm despite knowing it will cost him his life and despite his wife's desperate secret bargain to save him. His voice, "quiet but surprisingly deep from so slight a body," can hold an entire village entranced when he sings Celtic poetry while strumming a harp, his face taking on "a look of magical serenity."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-family-c-80-bc---55-bc'>Early Life and Family (c. 80 BC - 55 BC)</h3>

<p>The Fisher was born around 80 BC into a family with distinctive hereditary traits—the white forelock and webbed hands—that marked several river families. His father and grandfather before him also bore these characteristics, establishing a lineage connected to the Thames for generations.</p>

<p>By the time the narrative begins in 54 BC, he has built a life as a fisherman in a small hamlet on a gravel spit opposite the twin hills of Londinos. The hamlet, consisting of half a dozen circular thatched huts surrounded by a wattle stockade, becomes an island at high tide. The Fisher's expertise makes him essential to the community's survival, as he skillfully sets nets, spears fish, and navigates the river's tidal waters.</p>

<p>He marries Cartimandua, a striking woman with raven-dark hair and heavy breasts, and together they have three children: Segovax (age nine in 54 BC), little Branwen (about six), and a baby boy just learning to walk. The Fisher adores his family, particularly delighting in teaching Segovax the skills and knowledge a Celtic man must possess. After long hours of toiling, he sings to the villagers by firelight, his deep voice and Celtic harp creating moments of peace and beauty.</p>

<h3 id='spring-54-bc-caesars-shadow'>Spring 54 BC: Caesar's Shadow</h3>

<p>When news arrives that Julius Caesar is preparing to invade Britain again, the Fisher's hamlet becomes strategically important due to the ford near the druid's island upstream—the first place where the Thames can be safely crossed from the estuary. A dark-bearded noble, a captain under Cassivelaunus, arrives to organize river defenses.</p>

<p>The Fisher participates in the dawn ceremony when the druids offer a magnificent bronze shield to the river gods, rowing the senior druid out into midstream. He does not yet know that his wife has made a terrible bargain with the noble captain—trading their daughter Branwen into slavery in exchange for the Fisher being assigned to guard the evacuating families rather than fight the Romans.</p>

<h3 id='summer-54-bc-the-journey-to-the-sea'>Summer 54 BC: The Journey to the Sea</h3>

<p>In midsummer, the Fisher surprises Segovax with the long-promised trip to see the sea. They prepare the hamlet's wicker boat—a light vessel with osier wickerwork hull and leather sail—and set off at dawn on the ebb tide. The Fisher teaches his son about the river's features, the great chalk ridges, and the territories of different tribes.</p>

<p>As they drift down the widening Thames toward the estuary, the Fisher shares stories his grandfather told him about ancient times when ice covered the land. When they reach the open sea, he watches his son's wonder with quiet satisfaction, though he warns that the sea is crueler than the river: "Men drown out there."</p>

<p>On their return journey, they encounter rafts ferrying magnificent Celtic chariots across the river. The Fisher helps with the crossing and meets Cassivelaunus himself—the great chief of the tribes north of the Thames. The imposing leader, a huge figure with long trailing moustaches, speaks warmly with the humble fisherman, places his hand on his shoulder in recognition, and gives him a brooch. For Segovax, watching his father receive this honor from the greatest chief on the island is a moment of pure pride.</p>

<p>The Fisher returns from this encounter preoccupied, knowing now that the Romans are definitely coming. More significantly, he has sworn an oath to Cassivelaunus to fight at Londinos—an oath his wife knows nothing about.</p>

<h3 id='preparations-for-battle-july-54-bc'>Preparations for Battle (July 54 BC)</h3>

<p>As Caesar's invasion force lands and begins marching through Kent, defenses intensify at the ford. The Fisher works with other men driving pointed stakes into the riverbed and building a stout wooden palisade along the druid's island. The labor is backbreaking, and the men camp at the ford for days. The Fisher's curved spine causes him pain, and he looks increasingly strained, but he never shirks his duty.</p>

<p>When the order comes for the women and children to evacuate upriver, the Fisher prepares for battle. He takes down his sword—a typical Celtic weapon with a long iron blade and a pommel carved as a fierce man's head—from where it has been kept wrapped and oiled. Despite his physical frailty, he seems transformed, "a determined masculinity that overcame his physical frailty," making him appear as a noble warrior.</p>

<p>He speaks gravely to Segovax: "If anything happens to me, you will be the man of the family. You must look after your mother and your sister and brother."</p>

<h3 id='the-fatal-choice-54-bc'>The Fatal Choice (54 BC)</h3>

<p>When the dark-bearded captain orders the Fisher to lead the evacuation party upriver as a guard, Cartimandua feels a flood of relief—her secret bargain has worked. But then, to everyone's shock, the Fisher refuses.</p>

<p>"I cannot," he says, explaining that he swore an oath to Cassivelaunus only days before—to fight at Londinos. He produces the brooch the great chief gave him as proof. An oath, especially to a chief, is sacred in the Celtic world. The captain, though frustrated, cannot override it. Cartimandua's bargain collapses, and her husband remains to face the Romans.</p>

<p>As the boats carrying his wife and children depart, the Fisher watches them go with "a sense of melancholy, and yet also of satisfaction." He is glad that his son heard about his oath to the great British chief, establishing his honor before the community despite his physical limitations.</p>

<h3 id='death-at-the-ford-54-bc'>Death at the Ford (54 BC)</h3>

<p>When Caesar's disciplined legions advance across the river, the Fisher joins the Celtic forces in their defense. The battle is brutal. Despite the Celts' bravery, their chariots and infantry cannot break the Romans' disciplined formations. The Romans' third rush proves decisive.</p>

<p>The Fisher falls with sword in hand, exactly as the old druid's second sight had foreseen. His body lies near the water, his thin face gazing up at the sky, his mouth wide open giving him a vacant, pathetic air. A short, broad Roman sword has opened a frightful gash in his side. The brooch from Cassivelaunus is still pinned to his tunic.</p>

<p>Segovax finds his father's body at sunset, kneeling beside it and touching his beard, racked with sobs. When Roman soldiers approach, the boy grabs his father's sword to defend the body. Julius Caesar himself, passing by on horseback, is amused by the small boy's fierce determination and orders the soldiers to leave him alone, remarking: "Here's a brave young Celt. He still won't give up. Better leave him alone, centurion, or he might kill us all!"</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='cartimandua-wife'>Cartimandua (wife)</h3>

<p>The Fisher's relationship with his wife is one of deep mutual love, though tragically complicated by her secret bargain. Cartimandua adores her husband—Segovax observes this repeatedly. Her passion for him drives her to desperate measures: "She desired him. She wanted to protect him. She needed him. She found it hard to imagine her existence without him."</p>

<p>The Fisher, in turn, is devoted to her and completely trusting. He has no idea of her arrangement with the noble captain to trade Branwen for his safety. When he unknowingly destroys her plan by revealing his oath to Cassivelaunus, it is not out of disregard for her, but because he cannot comprehend that she would make such a bargain. His honor and his oath take precedence, though it costs him his life and his family their protector.</p>

<h3 id='segovax-son'>Segovax (son)</h3>

<p>The Fisher's relationship with his nine-year-old son is the emotional heart of his character. They share not only physical traits (the white hair tuft, the large eyes, the connection to water), but a deep bond of affection and learning. The Fisher takes endless pleasure in teaching Segovax the skills of river life: setting nets, thatching, spearing fish, and reciting ancestral lineages and tribal relationships.</p>

<p>The journey to see the sea represents the culmination of their relationship—a perfect day alone together that Segovax treasures. When Cassivelaunus honors his father, Segovax's heart swells with pride, and he later risks everything, paddling all night downriver, hoping to fight beside him.</p>

<p>The Fisher teaches by example as much as instruction. Though aware his son notices his physical weakness, he consistently demonstrates courage and integrity. His final instructions to Segovax—"you will be the man of the family"—pass on the burden of responsibility to his son. After his death, the old druid helps Segovax honor his father's memory by breaking his sword and throwing it into the river, telling the boy: "The river is your father now."</p>

<h3 id='branwen-daughter'>Branwen (daughter)</h3>

<p>Though less prominently featured than his relationship with Segovax, the Fisher clearly loves his little daughter with her uncontrollable temper. Before leaving for battle, he intends to tell her to be good but realizes "the absurdity of the idea" and instead simply gives her a hug and a kiss. This moment captures both his humor and affection.</p>

<h3 id='the-druid'>The Druid</h3>

<p>The Fisher has a relationship of quiet service to the ancient druid who lives on the island upstream. When summoned, he obediently rows the priest upriver, sometimes for many miles. During the dawn ceremony, he poles the raft carrying the druid and the bronze shield out into midstream. The priest, who "could remember this fellow's father, with webbed hands like the little boy's. And his father before that," sees the Fisher as part of the river's eternal continuity, though he also foresees the fisherman's fate.</p>

<h3 id='cassivelaunus'>Cassivelaunus</h3>

<p>Though brief, the Fisher's encounter with the great British chief is transformative. Cassivelaunus treats the humble fisherman with warmth and respect, placing his hand on his shoulder and giving him a brooch. This gesture elevates the Fisher from anonymous peasant to recognized warrior, and the oath he swears becomes his defining choice. When forced to choose between family safety and his sworn word, his honor to Cassivelaunus proves unbreakable.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>The Fisher lives at a pivotal moment in British history—the cusp between Celtic independence and Roman conquest. The Thames region in 54 BC is inhabited by Celtic tribes who have lived on the island for centuries, dwelling in round timbered huts, farming barley and oats, and maintaining rich bardic traditions. The area around Londinos serves as a border between the tribes of Cassivelaunus to the north and the Cantii tribe in the Kent peninsula to the south.</p>

<p>Julius Caesar's invasion represents an existential threat to this Celtic world. His first reconnaissance in 55 BC was driven back by British chariots and storms, giving the tribes false confidence. But the 54 BC invasion brings five legions and two thousand cavalry—a disciplined force that overwhelms Celtic bravery with Roman military organization.</p>

<p>The Fisher's death at the ford represents the beginning of the end for independent Celtic Britain. Though Caesar withdraws after the battle and doesn't immediately occupy the island, the engagement demonstrates Roman military superiority. The Fisher dies defending a way of life that, ultimately, cannot survive the Roman advance.</p>

<p>His role as a simple fisherman makes his sacrifice particularly poignant. He is not a warrior or noble—just a peasant trying to provide for his family. Yet when called upon, he honors his oath despite knowing he is physically outmatched. His death embodies the Celtic values of loyalty, honor, and tribal obligation that will gradually be replaced by Roman law and order.</p>

<p>The ford at Londinos where he dies will later become central to Roman London. The strategic importance that brings Roman legions to this spot—the first practical Thames crossing from the sea—will make it the site of Londinium, the Roman city that becomes London. The Fisher dies protecting a Celtic backwater that will become one of the world's great cities.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>The Fisher represents the archetypal "little man" of history—the ordinary person whose life and death are swept up in great events beyond his control. He is known only by his occupation, not even granted a proper name by history, yet his story reveals the human cost of Caesar's "triumphs."</p>

<p>His character embodies the tension between family duty and honor. Cartimandua's desperate bargain to save him reflects one choice—survival at any cost, even sacrificing a daughter. The Fisher's choice represents the opposite—upholding sworn oaths even when they lead to death. Neither choice is presented as clearly right or wrong; both arise from love and desperation in impossible circumstances.</p>

<p>The hereditary traits the Fisher bears—the white hair and webbed hands—symbolize his deep connection to the river and the continuity of life along the Thames. These ancient genetic markers suggest his family has lived by the river for countless generations, part of its eternal rhythm. The druid's final words to Segovax—"The river is your father now"—transform the Fisher from a mortal man into a timeless spirit of the Thames itself.</p>

<p>His physical frailty yet inner strength presents a recurring theme in Rutherford's work: true courage is not about physical prowess but about moral fortitude. The Fisher's curved spine and thin frame belie his determination. Though others are stronger, none is "kinder or more quietly determined." His transformation when he puts on his sword—from frail fisherman to noble warrior—shows that heroism can reside in unlikely vessels.</p>

<p>The Fisher's relationship with Segovax explores the transmission of values across generations. Through patient teaching and personal example, he passes on not just practical skills but honor, courage, and love for the river. His death, while tragic, completes this education—Segovax learns about grief, honor, and the price of oaths. The boy's failed attempt to fight beside his father, followed by his fierce defense of the body against Roman soldiers, shows the Fisher's courage living on in his son.</p>

<p>His death also illustrates the druid's premonition about the gods withdrawing from Britain. The Fisher represents the old Celtic world—oral tradition, bardic culture, sacred oaths, and connection to the land and river. His death at Roman hands symbolizes the defeat of this ancient way of life by a new order based on discipline, writing, and empire.</p>

<p>Finally, the Fisher embodies the river's role as the true constant in London's history. Rulers rise and fall, empires come and go, but the Thames continues its tidal breathing. The Fisher, who knows the river intimately and teaches his son that it "always provides," becomes in death part of that eternal flow. His broken sword, thrown into the waters, merges with the river that has sustained his family for generations and will continue long after Romans, Saxons, Normans, and all subsequent peoples have passed.</p>
