<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>David Bull was the son of Alderman Sampson Bull, a fair-haired, blue-eyed youth who came of age during the excitement of Richard the Lionheart's coronation and crusade. Inspired by ideals of chivalry and honor, he became disillusioned with his father's political machinations and died tragically at fifteen, murdered in the streets of London during the political crisis of October 1191. His death occurred on the same night his father helped broker London's support for Prince John against Chancellor Longchamp.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>At thirteen, David looked much like his father Sampson had at the same age: fair, broad-faced, with a ruddy complexion and bright blue eyes. By his mid-teens, after recovering from a serious illness, he had a slim and elegant but strong and healthy physique. His appearance embodied the robust Saxon heritage of the Bull family.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>David was a brave, frank, and emotionally open young man who yearned for meaning and greatness beyond the mercantile world of his father. He was deeply impressionable, particularly susceptible to ideals of chivalry, crusading valor, and nobility. The boy had a sincere religious sensibility and was drawn to his uncle Brother Michael's spiritual life.</p>

<p>David's character was marked by a fundamental honesty and directness inherited from his Saxon Bull ancestors - he liked things to be clear, with friends distinctly friends and enemies distinctly enemies. This straightforward nature made the complex political maneuverings of men like Pentecost Silversleeves incomprehensible to him.</p>

<p>He was also lonely, having lost his mother at twelve or thirteen, and desperately needed guidance and affection. This vulnerability made him particularly close to his stepmother Ida and his uncle Michael, both of whom represented the noble and spiritual ideals he admired. His relationship with his father was more complicated - he loved and respected Sampson Bull, but grew increasingly troubled by what he saw as his father's lack of principle.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1189-the-year-of-richards-coronation'>1189: The Year of Richard's Coronation</h3>

<p>In August 1189, the thirteen-year-old David stood in the crowd before the Temple gateway, eager to catch a glimpse of the newly arrived King Richard the Lionheart. When Richard rode through the gateway, the king briefly looked directly into David's eyes and smiled - a calculated gesture that nevertheless captured the boy completely. David immediately declared his intention to go on crusade, hoping his Uncle Michael would help persuade his father.</p>

<p>Later that month, Sampson Bull married Ida, a knight's widow whom the king had sold in marriage to raise funds for the crusade. David was initially shy with his new stepmother, but they quickly formed a close bond. When she gently offered to try to take his late mother's place, his eyes moistened with emotion.</p>

<p>At the family meal following Richard's coronation on September 3, Brother Michael raised the subject of David joining the crusade. Contrary to expectations, Sampson Bull was not immediately angry, though he pointed out the dangers and the reality that most crusaders never returned. Ida, despite her own opposition to losing the boy, supported David's wish as befitting the son of a knightly household. The discussion was interrupted by news of the riot against the Jews in London.</p>

<h3 id='september-october-1189-life-with-ida'>September-October 1189: Life with Ida</h3>

<p>David attended school at nearby St. Paul's during the day, but in the evenings he would sit with Ida. Having had no one to talk to at home for over a year following his mother's death, he opened up completely to his sympathetic stepmother, sharing every confidence. She understood his grief at being unable to go on crusade and became like a mother to him.</p>

<p>When the knight Gilbert de Godefroi stayed at the Bull house as a guest before departing on crusade, David fell into something like hero-worship. He would follow the knight around, watch him practice with sword and mace, help his groom clean the knight's mail, and marvel at the knight's coat of arms (a white swan on red background). When Godefroi swung into his saddle, it seemed to David that the knight was almost a god. One morning, after watching the knight ride out, David remarked to Ida, "I wish my father was like that."</p>

<p>Ida's thoughtless response - "Don't be silly. Just look at your father. You can see at once that he's only a merchant" - planted a poison in David's mind. From that moment, he began to see his father as base and, despite their blood relationship, to secretly despise him. Brother Michael witnessed this transformation and grieved.</p>

<h3 id='autumn-1189-spring-1191-illness-and-recovery'>Autumn 1189-Spring 1191: Illness and Recovery</h3>

<p>David fell seriously ill in the autumn of 1189, becoming pale and thin. The illness returned worse in January 1190, during bitter cold weather. For weeks, the fifteen-year-old lay like a pale ghost, close to death. Brother Michael prayed constantly at his bedside, sometimes joined by his father. Ida told him to fight, promising to find him a noble wife.</p>

<p>During his illness, David's spiritual side deepened. He talked with Brother Michael about heaven and hell, the nature of worldly desires, and the religious life. He expressed regret that he had "done nothing" and wished he had gone on crusade.</p>

<p>David slowly recovered through February and March 1190. By late March he was walking vigorously with his uncle, and in late April, he impulsively dove into the Thames at Aldwych with other youths, showing that his body was strong and healthy again. Despite these high spirits, he remained often pensive, continued to question Brother Michael about religion, and would say sadly, "My life has been spared by God: but I'm not sure for what."</p>

<h3 id='may-june-1191-the-monastery-plan'>May-June 1191: The Monastery Plan</h3>

<p>In May 1191, while his father and Ida were at Bocton, David remained in London in the company of Brother Michael. The monk, convinced that God had saved David for a special purpose, decided to use his mother's legacy to secure places for both David and himself at Westminster Abbey. On a warm May night, Brother Michael suggested to David that he might have a vocation for religious life. The impressionable youth, under the influence of the saintly man he so admired, blushed with pleasure and cried, "Oh yes. I do."</p>

<p>When Sampson Bull and Ida returned in June, Brother Michael revealed his plan. To his shock, Ida reacted with fury, declaring that David would marry into a noble family, not become a monk. She called Michael a "meddling old virgin" and ordered him out of the house. She and Sampson Bull, in rare agreement, immediately took David back to Bocton.</p>

<p>David spent the summer at Bocton recovering fully, going on long walks with his father, reading knightly tales with Ida, and finding contentment he had never known. The monastic episode was largely forgotten in the peace of the old manor and the excitement of news from Richard's crusade.</p>

<h3 id='october-1191-disillusionment-and-death'>October 1191: Disillusionment and Death</h3>

<p>On October 7, 1191, David was watching from Ludgate for signs of the forces approaching London - Prince John and the council were advancing to depose Chancellor Longchamp. At dusk, the gates closed, and David noticed a strange procession of twenty hooded horsemen being led through quiet streets. Following them curiously to near the London Stone, he approached a large figure with a lantern and was shocked to discover it was his father. When he asked who the riders were, his father hissed, "It's Prince John, you fool. Now go."</p>

<p>That evening, David witnessed his father explaining to Ida the deal he and the other aldermen had struck: in return for London opening its gates to John and supporting his deposition of Longchamp - effectively betraying King Richard's appointed chancellor - the city would be granted the status of commune and be allowed to choose its own mayor. Ida, horrified, called her husband a traitor for selling England to "that devil John" merely so London merchants could have their political privileges.</p>

<p>David stared at his father "through tears...not only with shock but, for the first time in his life, with hatred, before he rushed out of the house." The boy who had wanted to die for King Richard could not bear to see his father betray the Lionheart's cause for political advantage.</p>

<p>Wandering dejectedly through the dark streets near Cornhill, David encountered Pentecost Silversleeves standing over a knight the clerk had just mortally wounded. When Silversleeves asked for news, David, still distressed, blurted out, "Do you know what has happened? My father and the aldermen have sold London to Prince John."</p>

<p>Realizing the boy could expose his earlier assurances to Longchamp that London would stay loyal, and recognizing that David knew too much, Silversleeves acted quickly. He told David that all was not lost, that he would still fight for the Lionheart. When David enthusiastically declared "I will" fight for Richard, Silversleeves handed David his own sword, picked up the dead knight's weapon, and "with a single, easy thrust, he plunged the knight's sword into David Bull's heart."</p>

<p>Silversleeves arranged the scene to make it appear that the dying knight had killed David from behind before dying himself. The ruse worked - when the dead knight's companions returned, they concluded that "the boy attacked him from behind" but that their comrade "managed to kill the little brute before he died."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='sampson-bullsampson-bull-1140html'><a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Sampson Bull</a></h3>

<p>David's relationship with his father was loving but increasingly complicated. Initially, he admired his father and the Bulls were a close family, but after Ida's comment about merchants being inferior to knights, David began to secretly despise his father despite loving him. During David's illness, Sampson was broken with worry and grief, showing his deep love for his only surviving son. The two grew closer during the summer at Bocton. However, David's discovery of his father's deal with Prince John filled him with hatred for the first time, as it represented a betrayal of everything David idealized in King Richard. Sampson's grief at David's death was so complete that he shook with silent tears even at the triumphant ceremony establishing London's commune.</p>

<h3 id='ida-bullida-bull-1156html'><a href="characters/Ida-Bull-1156.html">Ida Bull</a></h3>

<p>Ida became David's surrogate mother after marrying his father in August 1189. Despite initial shyness, they quickly became close. She listened to him kindly and he shared every confidence with her. Ida understood his grief at not being allowed to join the crusade and promised him things would get better. During his near-fatal illness, she told him "I love him as my own," and encouraged him to fight for life. Ida also unwittingly poisoned David's view of his father with her thoughtless remark about merchants being inferior to knights. She fiercely opposed Brother Michael's plan to make David a monk, insisting he would marry into nobility instead. After David's death, she felt so guilty that she allowed Sampson to strike her twice before revealing she was pregnant.</p>

<h3 id='brother-michael-bullbrother-michael-bull-1143html'><a href="characters/Brother-Michael-Bull-1143.html">Brother Michael Bull</a></h3>

<p>Brother Michael was David's beloved uncle and spiritual guide. David had "huge respect" for the learned monk and was fascinated by his knowledge of the world. During David's illness, Michael prayed at his bedside constantly and helped the boy explore religious questions about heaven, hell, and the purpose of earthly desires. As David recovered, they took long vigorous walks together, with Michael sometimes putting his arm around the boy to keep him warm. Michael became convinced that God had saved David for a special religious purpose and planned to bring them both into Westminster Abbey. However, his proposal that David become a monk was rejected furiously by Ida and Sampson. Sister Mabel later shocked Michael with the suggestion that he had fallen into an unnatural love for the boy - a realization that devastated the innocent monk. After David's death, the grieving Sampson Bull turned to his brother Michael for comfort.</p>

<h3 id='gilbert-de-godefroi'>Gilbert de Godefroi</h3>

<p>David was in awe of this crusading knight who stayed at the Bull house. He followed Godefroi around, watched him practice, and helped care for his equipment. The knight occasionally paused to talk to David "in his quiet, serious way," which the boy treasured. When Godefroi rode his charger, David thought the knight "almost a god." This admiration intensified David's desire to join the crusade and his dissatisfaction with his merchant father's world.</p>

<h3 id='pentecost-silversleeves'>Pentecost Silversleeves</h3>

<p>David knew Silversleeves as a king's man and clerk of the Exchequer. He had no idea of the man's calculating nature. When David encountered Silversleeves standing over a dead knight on the night of October 7, his trust and his distressed emotional state led him to reveal his father's betrayal of Richard's chancellor. This sealed his fate - Silversleeves murdered him to prevent exposure, then positioned the bodies to suggest David had attacked the knight from behind.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>David's brief life spanned one of the most dramatic periods in medieval English history. He came of age during the reign of Richard the Lionheart (1189-1199), when crusading fever was at its height and the ideals of chivalry were reaching their full flower. The Third Crusade, proclaimed by the Pope to liberate Jerusalem from Saladin, captured the imagination of all Christendom.</p>

<p>However, Richard's long absence from England created a power vacuum that his brother John and various factions sought to exploit. The tension between Chancellor William Longchamp (Richard's appointed regent) and Prince John came to a head in October 1191, when London's merchant oligarchy, led by men like Sampson Bull, seized the opportunity to extract major political concessions - including the right to elect their own mayor - in exchange for supporting John against Longchamp.</p>

<p>David's death occurred on the very night of this crucial political deal, symbolizing the collision between the idealistic world of crusading chivalry that David admired and the pragmatic political maneuvering that actually governed the realm. The gap between merchant wealth and noble status was beginning to blur in this period, with rich merchants like Sampson Bull buying estates and marrying into the knightly class, but traditional attitudes about the superiority of nobility - attitudes that Ida articulated and David absorbed - remained powerful.</p>

<p>The riot against the Jews on Richard's coronation day, which David witnessed, marked the beginning of a dark period for England's Jewish community. These attacks, ostensibly motivated by crusading zeal against "infidels at home," were also driven by resentment of Jewish wealth and the desire to cancel debts.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>David Bull embodies the collision between medieval idealism and political reality. Raised in a merchant's household but drawn to the spiritual and chivalric ideals represented by his uncle and stepmother, David yearned for a life of meaning beyond commerce. His encounter with Richard the Lionheart at thirteen fixed his imagination on crusade and service to the heroic king. His worship of the knight Godefroi intensified his dissatisfaction with his merchant origins.</p>

<p>His trajectory represents the casualties of political pragmatism. While his father Sampson Bull was securing London's liberties and building the foundations of the city's future self-governance, David could see only betrayal of an idealized king. The boy's inability to understand the complex necessities of politics - that the King of France could be both ally and enemy, that loyalty might require compromise - reflects his youth but also the gap between romantic idealism and political reality.</p>

<p>David's death at the hands of Pentecost Silversleeves is deeply ironic. He died believing he was standing up for Richard the Lionheart, but he was actually the victim of the same political calculations he despised in his father. Silversleeves, the epitome of the calculating political creature, murdered David simply to protect his own position, then used the boy's dead body to facilitate his own change of allegiance from Longchamp to John.</p>

<p>The tragedy of David's death brought Ida and Sampson Bull together in their shared grief, even as it destroyed their son's idealistic vision of the world. That Sampson stood at the ceremony establishing London's commune with tears streaming down his face suggests the terrible price of the political triumph he had helped engineer - he had gained London's liberties but lost his only son.</p>

<p>David's story illustrates the dangerous innocence of youth and the destructive power of romantic idealization. Ida's careless comment about merchants being inferior to knights poisoned David's relationship with his father and made him susceptible to despising the very qualities - practicality, shrewdness, the ability to navigate complex situations - that had made his family prosperous and powerful. In seeking a noble and meaningful life, David instead found a meaningless death in a dark street, murdered by a man he trusted, on a night when his father's political acumen was reshaping London's future.</p>
