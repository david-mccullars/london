<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Richard Meredith is a physician-turned-clergyman whose life embodies the intersection of faith, science, and reason in late 17th-century England. Born as the late-life son of the Reverend Edmund Meredith, Richard initially pursued medicine and became a member of the prestigious Royal Society before taking holy orders. He heroically serves during the Great Plague of 1665, conducting early epidemiological investigations, and later becomes vicar of St Bride's in Fleet Street. Throughout his life, he bridges the worlds of scientific inquiry and religious duty, representing the era's emerging rational approach to understanding both nature and faith.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>No physical description provided in the text.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Richard Meredith possesses a naturally enquiring and analytical mind, perfectly suited to both his medical training and his later work with the Royal Society. He is characterized by his intellectual curiosity, rational skepticism, and genuine kindness. Unlike his father, who was somewhat vain and ambitious, Richard displays authentic compassion and humility.</p>

<p>His bravery is demonstrated through his actions rather than words – he unhesitatingly remains in plague-stricken London when he could have fled to safety, donning the fearsome leather plague doctor's outfit to tend the sick. Yet this courage is tempered with scientific frustration; he is troubled by his inability to understand or cure the plague, viewing his ignorance as a failing rather than an inevitability.</p>

<p>Richard embodies the emerging spirit of the Enlightenment – he is skeptical of superstition (dismissing Sir Julius's fear of Jane Wheeler's "curse" as nonsense), enthusiastic about scientific progress, and comfortable with ambiguity in matters of faith. He maintains friendly relations with Dissenters and Huguenots despite doctrinal differences, showing pragmatic tolerance. His personality reflects the transition from medieval credulity to modern rationalism, though he remains genuinely devout in his own Anglican way.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-c-1640-1660'>Early Life (c. 1640-1660)</h3>

<p>Richard was born around 1640 as the late-life son of the Reverend Edmund Meredith and his wife Matilda. His father, a vicar at St Lawrence Silversleeves, had married at nearly sixty years old. Richard grew up during the tumultuous period of the English Civil War and Commonwealth, in a household that had adapted to survive the religious upheavals of the era.</p>

<h3 id='medical-career-and-the-royal-society-1660-1665'>Medical Career and the Royal Society (1660-1665)</h3>

<p>At Oxford, Richard decided to become a physician rather than follow his father into the ministry, partly because he had no wish to be a Puritan minister and his father had warned him about the compromises required to survive. His naturally analytical mind suited him well to medicine, particularly as the field was undergoing a transformation from medieval practices to modern scientific investigation.</p>

<p>Richard became acquainted with the emerging Royal Society of London, attending lectures and befriending notable figures including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher Wren</a>. He delivered a paper to the Society that earned praise from Wren and others, demonstrating his intellectual abilities. In the year before the Great Plague, he was elected a full member of the Royal Society – an honor that filled him with joy and pride.</p>

<h3 id='the-great-plague-1665-1666'>The Great Plague (1665-1666)</h3>

<p>When the plague struck London in 1665, Richard Meredith distinguished himself by remaining in the city despite having the opportunity to flee. <a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Julius Ducket</a> repeatedly urged him to come to safety at Bocton in Kent, but Richard insisted his duty lay in London.</p>

<p>He donned the remarkable plague doctor's uniform – a huge waxed leather outfit with a cone-shaped body, leather gloves, and a beaked mask stuffed with aromatic herbs – and went out daily to tend the sick. His dog Ned was initially terrified of this monstrous appearance. Tragically, Julius shot and disposed of Ned, believing (incorrectly) that dogs carried the contagion, though he meant well in trying to protect Richard.</p>

<p>Throughout the plague, Richard conducted careful observations, attempting to understand its transmission and causes. He witnessed the horror of both forms – bubonic and pneumonic – and developed theories about contagion spread through the spittle and phlegm of infected persons. He noted that one patient's sneeze directly into a child's face seemed to lead to the child's infection. He also observed that people living on floating islands in the Thames remained remarkably plague-free, though he could not explain why.</p>

<p>By chance, Richard attended to <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Wheeler</a> (formerly Jane Fleming) in her final hours, writing her will without realizing until afterward who she was. Unknown to him, a plague-carrying flea from a dead rat beneath the floorboards attached itself to his coat during this visit, but jumped to the nurse before it could infect him – a narrow escape that saved his life.</p>

<p>The plague killed perhaps 100,000 Londoners. Richard survived but was frustrated by his inability to understand or prevent the disease, hoping one day to present findings to the Royal Society on its true cause.</p>

<h3 id='the-great-fire-1666'>The Great Fire (1666)</h3>

<p>During the Great Fire of September 1666, Richard again remained in the devastated city, helping where he could. He encountered Samuel Pepys and other notables, witnessing the destruction of much of London. His own house in Watling Street survived, as the fire was stopped before reaching that area.</p>

<h3 id='ordination-and-st-brides-1670s-1708'>Ordination and St Bride's (1670s-1708)</h3>

<p>Following his experiences during the plague and fire, Richard took holy orders and became vicar of St Bride's in Fleet Street after the church was rebuilt. His appointment to this prominent living was fortunate and reflected his gentleman status and connections through the Royal Society.</p>

<p>As a clergyman, Richard maintained his scientific interests and continued his Royal Society activities. He was present at the opening of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in 1675, enthusiastically explaining to Julius how the observatory would enable mariners to calculate longitude using "Greenwich time" – a concept that would become fundamental to global navigation.</p>

<p>Richard balanced his clerical duties with scientific pursuits, though this sometimes frustrated him when parishioners like Julius fixated on superstitious concerns (such as Jane Wheeler's deathbed curse) rather than appreciating scientific wonders. He maintained friendly relations with Dissenters and foreign Protestants, helping <a href="characters/Eugene-Penny-1648.html">Eugene Penny</a> and <a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful Carpenter</a> find work and providing pastoral care regardless of denominational differences. He pragmatically gave communion to Dissenters who needed it for legal purposes, acknowledging the absurdity of such requirements.</p>

<h3 id='later-life-1680s-1708'>Later Life (1680s-1708)</h3>

<p>During the Exclusion Crisis and concerns about Catholic plots, Richard maintained a levelheaded, skeptical approach to hysteria about the "Popish Plot," recognizing it as largely fraudulent. When O Be Joyful came to him with tales of a Jesuit conspiracy in 1688, Richard, along with <a href="characters/Earl-St-James-1859.html">Lord St James</a>, compassionately but firmly locked the confused carpenter in the crypt of St Bride's to prevent him from embarrassing himself, later releasing him with gentle reassurance.</p>

<p>Richard married late in life, around 1694, following his father's pattern. He married well, and in 1695 was blessed with a son. Eugene Penny, grateful for Richard's help in securing him work with the great clockmaker Tompion, gave Richard one of Tompion's new pocket watches with a cylinder escapement to celebrate the birth.</p>

<p>In 1701, Christopher Wren designed a remarkable new steeple for St Bride's – a tiered structure taller even than the Monument, with open arches arranged like an inverted telescope, topped with an obelisk. This became one of London's great landmarks and a source of pride for Richard.</p>

<p>As late as 1708, Richard remained active and intellectually vibrant. He was observed conducting experiments in St Paul's Cathedral, dropping objects from the gallery to test Newton's theory of gravity, explaining enthusiastically that the dome provided perfect controlled conditions for such experiments. The Royal Society planned to conduct a series of experiments there. His combination of clerical office and scientific investigation continued to the end of his recorded life.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='edmund-meredith'>Edmund Meredith</h3>

<p>Richard's relationship with his father was marked by both affection and difference. Edmund had been a somewhat vain and worldly man who became a clergyman more from necessity than calling, and who never quite achieved his ambition of becoming Dean of St Paul's. Richard seems to have inherited his father's intelligence and social grace but not his vanity or ambition. Edmund's warning about the compromises required in religious life influenced Richard's initial choice to pursue medicine rather than the ministry. Julius noted that after Edmund's dramatic death from a stroke while preaching, he "became quite friendly with Richard," suggesting their relationship may have become closer after the father's passing.</p>

<h3 id='julius-ducket-later-earl-of-st-james'>Julius Ducket (later Earl of St James)</h3>

<p>Richard enjoyed a close, warm friendship with Julius that lasted throughout both their lives. Julius repeatedly tried to save Richard during the plague, begging him to come to safety at Bocton. Though Julius shot Richard's dog Ned (believing he was protecting Richard from contagion), Richard apparently forgave this well-intentioned act. Julius supported Richard's career and they frequently conversed about scientific matters, though Julius sometimes frustrated Richard by focusing on superstitious concerns rather than scientific wonders. In 1688, they worked together to handle O Be Joyful's delusions about a Popish plot with compassionate pragmatism.</p>

<h3 id='christopher-wren'>Christopher Wren</h3>

<p>Richard enjoyed a collegial friendship with Wren through the Royal Society. Wren's praise of Richard's paper to the Society meant a great deal to him. They shared interests in astronomy, mathematics, and architecture. Wren designed the magnificent steeple for Richard's church of St Bride's in 1701, creating one of London's landmarks. Their friendship exemplified the creative collaboration between science and other fields that characterized the Royal Society.</p>

<h3 id='eugene-penny'>Eugene Penny</h3>

<p>Richard befriended the young Huguenot watchmaker through O Be Joyful Carpenter and helped Eugene find work with the master clockmaker Tompion, both at the Royal Observatory and in Tompion's workshop. Richard offered Eugene counsel when he was homesick for France, advising him to seek his father's permission before returning. Later, when Eugene fled France during the persecution of Huguenots, Richard again helped him resettle in London and regain his position with Tompion. Their friendship bridged Anglican and French Reformed Protestant traditions, demonstrating Richard's ecumenical tolerance.</p>

<h3 id='o-be-joyful-carpenter'>O Be Joyful Carpenter</h3>

<p>Richard maintained a lifelong friendship with O Be Joyful, despite their theological differences. He helped O Be Joyful find work with Grinling Gibbons and repeatedly tried to reassure him about religious controversies, though O Be Joyful often remained unconvinced. Richard patiently explained theological and scientific matters to him, and when O Be Joyful became delusional about a Popish plot in 1688, Richard compassionately locked him in the church crypt for his own protection rather than letting him make a dangerous fool of himself. He later reassured O Be Joyful and continued their friendship, demonstrating genuine pastoral care.</p>

<h3 id='samuel-pepys'>Samuel Pepys</h3>

<p>Richard knew Pepys through the Royal Society and Navy Board circles. During the plague, they encountered each other and discussed the true death toll, which Pepys revealed was higher than official figures showed. Pepys expressed hope that Richard might one day present findings to the Royal Society on the plague's true cause, recognizing Richard's careful observations.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Richard Meredith's life (c. 1640-1708+) spanned one of England's most transformative periods. Born during the Civil War, he came of age during the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, lived through the Great Plague (1665) and Great Fire (1666), witnessed the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and saw the establishment of the Bank of England and the Act of Settlement securing Protestant succession.</p>

<p>His career perfectly embodied the emergence of modern scientific thought. The Royal Society, founded in 1660 and granted a royal charter in 1662, represented a new approach to understanding nature through observation and experiment rather than ancient authority. Richard's generation included revolutionary thinkers like Isaac Newton, whose <i>Principia Mathematica</i> (1687) fundamentally changed how humanity understood the physical universe. Robert Boyle's experimental method, William Harvey's circulation discoveries, and Christopher Wren's mathematical approach to architecture all influenced Richard's worldview.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in 1675 symbolized England's growing maritime ambitions and the practical applications of scientific knowledge. Richard's enthusiastic explanation of "Greenwich time" as a standard for global navigation reflected England's emerging role as a dominant sea power and trading nation.</p>

<p>As a clergyman, Richard navigated the complex religious landscape of Restoration and post-Revolution England. The Church of England had been restored but remained contested – high church Anglicans, Presbyterian-leaning Puritans, Dissenters, Quakers, and Catholics all competed for influence. The fear of Catholic succession, the Exclusion Crisis, the brief reign of Catholic James II, and the "Glorious Revolution" that replaced him with Protestant William and Mary all shaped the religious anxieties of Richard's era.</p>

<p>Richard represented a new type of Anglican clergyman – educated, rational, tolerant, and more interested in natural philosophy than theological disputes. His pragmatic approach to Dissenters, his skepticism about witch-hunts and popish plots, and his focus on scientific inquiry over religious persecution embodied the emerging Enlightenment values that would characterize 18th-century England.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Richard Meredith represents the emergence of the Enlightenment mind within the framework of traditional religious society. His character embodies several key themes:</p>

<p><strong>Science and Faith Reconciled</strong>: Unlike the stereotype of inevitable conflict between science and religion, Richard seamlessly integrates both. He serves God through healing the sick, understanding nature through careful observation, and sees no contradiction between Anglican Christianity and Newton's laws. His experiments in St Paul's Cathedral symbolically unite these realms – the church building becomes a laboratory for testing gravitational theory.</p>

<p><strong>The Birth of Modern Medicine</strong>: Richard's plague observations represent early epidemiology – he carefully notes symptoms, attempts to trace transmission, and seeks natural rather than supernatural explanations. His frustration at not understanding the plague's cause reflects the emerging expectation that diseases have discoverable mechanisms. Though he couldn't know about bacteria and fleas, his methods were sound and his observations valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Rational Tolerance</strong>: Richard's dismissal of superstition (Jane Wheeler's "curse"), his skepticism about the Popish Plot, and his friendship with Dissenters and Huguenots demonstrate an enlightened tolerance rare in his era. He represents the growing conviction that reasonable people of different faiths can coexist and that superstition should yield to reason.</p>

<p><strong>Social Mobility Through Merit</strong>: Richard's election to the Royal Society and his successful career demonstrate how intellectual merit could open doors in late 17th-century England. The Royal Society brought together aristocrats, gentlemen, and talented commoners based on intellectual contribution rather than birth alone.</p>

<p><strong>Continuity and Change</strong>: The Meredith family's evolution – from Richard's theatrical grandfather, to his compromise-making father, to Richard himself who genuinely integrates multiple roles – shows how English society adapted through successive crises. Richard's late marriage and son (born 1695) extend the family line into the 18th century, carrying forward these Enlightenment values.</p>

<p><strong>London as Intellectual Capital</strong>: Through Richard's eyes, we see London emerging as a center of scientific thought – the Royal Society, the Royal Observatory, the rebuilding of St Paul's as a monument to mathematical architecture. His enthusiasm for "Greenwich time" captures London's growing global significance.</p>

<p>In the larger narrative of <i>London</i>, Richard Meredith represents a crucial transition point – from the superstitious, conflict-ridden 17th century toward the more rational, commercially successful 18th century. He bridges worlds: medicine and ministry, science and faith, tradition and innovation. His survival of both plague and fire, his productive career, and his successful late-life marriage all suggest that reason, kindness, and courage enable not just survival but flourishing even in tumultuous times.</p>
