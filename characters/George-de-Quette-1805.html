<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>George de Quette is the grandson of the sporting <a href="characters/Sam-Dogget-1742.html">Earl of St James</a> and son of the austere <a href="characters/Lord-Bocton-1770.html">Lord Bocton</a>. A young aristocrat in early 19th-century London, George is renowned as "the wildest, and jolliest young buck in England," taking decidedly after his rakish grandfather rather than his stern, Tory father. Despite his reputation for sporting pursuits and legendary exploits with women, George possesses unexpected depth—a well-read, personable young man who treats people of all ranks with genuine warmth and later becomes involved in the Reform Bill debates of the 1830s.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>George is described as "on the short side but very compact" with a professional boxer's physique. He has a distinctive white flash in his dark hair (a hereditary trait from his father's side) and, for some reason, habitually wears a red kerchief round his neck. When Eugene Penny first encounters him, George is stripped to the waist at Mendoza's boxing establishment, demonstrating a professional boxing stance.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>George de Quette embodies an appealing combination of aristocratic privilege and democratic spirit. Unlike his cold, calculating father, he has inherited his grandfather's sporting nature, good humor, and disregard for social rank. He is genuinely friendly and personable, remembering people he's met casually and treating them with warmth regardless of their station.</p>

<p>Beyond his reputation as a sporting buck, George reveals surprising intellectual breadth. He has traveled extensively on the Continent for two years (sent by his father, presumably to mature him) and returned "quite unchanged"—a testament to his essential good nature. He reads widely, appreciating not just the fashionable Lord Byron but also John Keats, defending the latter despite social prejudice against the poet's non-gentle birth. His interests extend to banking and commerce, and he demonstrates a shrewd understanding of business principles learned from his grandfather.</p>

<p>George shows genuine loyalty and affection for his grandfather, seeking help from <a href="characters/Meredith-1788.html">Meredith</a> when the earl is arrested and later imprisoned in Bedlam. He is protective of his grandfather's pride, carefully arranging for Eugene Penny to pay the earl's parish rates anonymously so the old man won't know his grandson interfered. This combination of loyalty, discretion, and respect reveals George's essential decency beneath his rakish exterior.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='c-1820s-introduction-to-eugene-penny'>c. 1820s: Introduction to Eugene Penny</h3>

<p>When Eugene Penny first encounters George at Mendoza's boxing establishment, the young aristocrat has just knocked down a broker and is cheerfully asking if anyone else wants a fight. <a href="characters/Meredith-1788.html">Meredith</a> introduces them, and Eugene realizes he's meeting the famous George de Quette, whose reputation precedes him—"the wildest, and jolliest young buck in England. He could ride like a jockey, fight like a turkey-cock and took no account of social rank."</p>

<p>George has recently returned from a two-year tour of the Continent, sent by his father, from which he has returned "quite unchanged." The following week, George spots Eugene in the street, remembers him at once, and invites him into a coffee house for conversation. They discuss sporting events, but Eugene discovers the young aristocrat's interests are wider than supposed. George demonstrates considerable knowledge of France and Italy, discusses poetry (praising Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale" despite it being unfashionable), and shows interest in banking, asking Eugene about his life at the bank and his trading in futures.</p>

<p>George shares business philosophy he learned from his grandfather: "Study the form. Hedge your bets... You've got to be ruthless. If something doesn't work, get out, cut your losses, move on." This reveals both his affection for the old earl and his own understanding of practical affairs.</p>

<h3 id='december-1822-the-parish-rates-crisis'>December 1822: The Parish Rates Crisis</h3>

<p>When the Earl of St James is arrested for refusing to pay the exorbitant parish rates imposed by St Pancras vestry to fund their expensive new Grecian-style church, a worried-looking George rushes to <a href="characters/Meredith-1788.html">Meredith's</a> counting-house for help. He would pay the rates himself, he explains, "but my allowance won't run to it."</p>

<p>George and Meredith carefully orchestrate Eugene Penny's anonymous payment of the rates to the vestry, concerned that if the earl ever discovered they'd interfered, he would be furious. George's understanding of his grandfather's pride and his willingness to work behind the scenes to protect him demonstrates both affection and wisdom.</p>

<h3 id='1831-the-reform-bill-elections'>1831: The Reform Bill Elections</h3>

<p>As the Reform Bill debates heat up, George is seen standing with his grandfather at one of Lord Bocton's election speeches at St Pancras. When Zachary Carpenter cheerfully approaches and asks the earl if he's come to support his son, the old man bursts out: "Support Bocton? That traitor? I'm damned if I will!" Young George, notably, says nothing—a diplomatic silence that suggests he's caught between his grandfather's radical politics and his father's Tory position.</p>

<p>During the election campaign, Carpenter discovers that George himself is standing for Parliament in a pocket borough—a rotten borough that his grandfather has purchased for him. When Lord Bocton confronts the earl about not telling him George was standing, the old man shrugs: "Must have slipped my mind." The earl admits he has "no idea which way he'll vote" on reform, suggesting George has been given the seat but retains independence.</p>

<p>When the Reform Bill finally passes through the House of Commons in October 1831, "Lord Bocton and his son George had passed through the lobby together"—indicating George voted with his father for reform. This suggests George, despite his grandfather's radical influence, chose to support the moderate reform position.</p>

<h3 id='1832-the-bedlam-crisis'>1832: The Bedlam Crisis</h3>

<p>After the House of Lords throws out the Reform Bill (with the Earl of St James inexplicably voting against it due to mental confusion), Lord Bocton and Silversleeves have the old earl committed to Bedlam. Young George, as soon as he discovers what has happened to his grandfather, goes immediately to <a href="characters/Meredith-1788.html">Meredith</a> for advice.</p>

<p>Meredith's assessment is bleak: Lord Bocton will almost certainly succeed in getting the earl declared incapable. Meredith proposes to rescue the earl from Bedlam, but George can't do it himself because Bocton will have warned them to expect him. George points out practical concerns: "You'll have to hide him somewhere straight away though"—showing both his quick thinking and his commitment to helping his grandfather despite the risks.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='earl-of-st-james-grandfather'>Earl of St James (Grandfather)</h3>

<p>George clearly adores his grandfather and has taken after him in temperament and values. The text notes that at the mention of his grandson, the earl's eyes "softened a little. Young George was a very different matter"—indicating the earl's special affection for this grandson who resembles him. George has absorbed the earl's sporting spirit, business acumen, and democratic treatment of all ranks. When the earl faces legal troubles, George acts quickly and devotedly to help, though always with careful attention to protecting his grandfather's pride. The bond between them is one of genuine mutual affection and respect.</p>

<h3 id='lord-bocton-father'>Lord Bocton (Father)</h3>

<p>George's relationship with his father appears more distant and complex. Lord Bocton sent him on a two-year Continental tour, presumably hoping to mature or change him, but George returned "quite unchanged"—suggesting either resistance to his father's influence or simply being comfortable in his own skin. When Lord Bocton purchases a parliamentary seat for George without his knowledge, and when George votes for reform alongside his father, it suggests an evolving relationship. George diplomatically maintains silence when his grandfather denounces his father at the election meeting, caught between two men he presumably loves who are political opposites.</p>

<h3 id='meredith'>Meredith</h3>

<p>George is on friendly terms with <a href="characters/Meredith-1788.html">Meredith</a>, whom he encounters at Mendoza's boxing establishment and later turns to for help when his grandfather is in crisis. Meredith clearly has a protective relationship with the St James family (having been supported by the earl in establishing his bank) and willingly helps George rescue his grandfather from Bedlam. Their interaction suggests mutual respect and trust.</p>

<h3 id='eugene-penny'>Eugene Penny</h3>

<p>George demonstrates his characteristic friendliness and lack of class consciousness in his relationship with Eugene. After meeting casually at Mendoza's, he remembers Eugene the following week and invites him for coffee, treating the young bank clerk with genuine warmth and interest. Their conversation ranges widely, showing George's willingness to engage seriously with someone well below his social rank.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>George de Quette comes of age during the tumultuous Reform Bill era of the early 1830s, when England's political system was being fundamentally restructured. As a young aristocrat from a family divided between Tory conservatism (his father) and radical Whig principles (his grandfather), George represents a younger generation navigating the tensions between old privilege and democratic reform.</p>

<p>The pocket borough his grandfather purchases for him epitomizes the very system the Reform Bill aimed to abolish—constituencies with tiny electorates controlled by wealthy patrons. That George receives such a seat yet apparently votes for reform illustrates the paradox of many reformers who entered Parliament through the corrupt system they sought to eliminate. His position as an MP during this crucial period placed him at the center of historic changes that would reshape British democracy.</p>

<p>George's sporting lifestyle and rakish reputation reflect the culture of Regency bucks—young aristocrats who defined themselves through physical pursuits, gambling, and style rather than through studious application or serious politics. Yet his reading, his interest in commerce, and his political engagement suggest he represents a transitional figure: maintaining the color and dash of the Regency while adapting to the more serious, reform-minded culture of the 1830s.</p>

<p>His treatment of people regardless of rank—befriending Eugene Penny, the bank clerk—reflects changing social attitudes among some aristocrats, particularly those influenced by Whig principles of individual merit. This democratic spirit, inherited from his grandfather, positions George as part of a younger aristocracy that would help bridge old hierarchies and emerging middle-class influence.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>George de Quette embodies several key themes in the novel's exploration of family, heredity, and social change. Most prominently, he illustrates how temperament and values can skip a generation—taking after his sporting, radical grandfather rather than his austere, conservative father. This pattern of inheritance, both genetic (the white flash in his hair) and cultural (his personality and values), highlights the book's recurring interest in what truly passes from one generation to another.</p>

<p>His character also represents the complexity of the Reform era, showing how individual aristocrats navigated competing loyalties and principles. As someone who benefits from the old system of pocket boroughs yet apparently votes to abolish it, who loves both his radical grandfather and his Tory father, George exemplifies how historical change was often advanced by those with one foot in the old world and one in the new.</p>

<p>The contrast between George's reputation and his reality—the "wildest young buck in England" who reads Keats and understands banking—suggests the novel's broader theme that social stereotypes often obscure individual complexity. His genuine warmth and democratic treatment of people across class lines demonstrate that aristocratic privilege need not preclude human decency and progressive values.</p>

<p>Finally, George's devotion to his grandfather during the earl's decline into confusion and his father's attempt to have him declared mad represents the theme of loyalty across generations. In choosing to help rescue his grandfather from Bedlam, George takes a stand for love and family over legal authority and social propriety, affirming the human bonds that transcend political divisions.</p>
