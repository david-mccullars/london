<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Sep Dogget was born in 1742 as Lord Bocton, the legitimate heir to the Earl of St James, but was abandoned as an infant by his mother due to his physical abnormalities (webbed fingers and a white streak in his dark hair). Found by costermonger <a href="characters/Harry-Dogget-1710.html">Harry Dogget</a> near Seven Dials and raised as the twin brother of Sam, Sep grew up in the London streets never knowing his true identity. While his "twin" <a href="characters/Sam-Dogget-1742.html">Sam</a> was mistakenly restored to their aristocratic birthright, Sep remained with the Doggets and fulfilled his childhood dream of becoming a Thames fireman, happy in his working-class life and blissfully unaware of the inheritance he had lost.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Sep had distinctive hereditary features marking him as a member of the Dogget family line: a shock of white hair with a white streak running through darker hair, and webbed fingers. These same physical characteristics, inherited from his biological father's family (the Doggets), were shared with his adoptive brother Sam and had been passed down through the Dogget line, skipping Harry but present in Harry's father. Though not identical twins, Sep and Sam looked very alike, both barefoot street urchins who smoked long pipes as was common for children in Georgian London.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Sep was the more serious and conscientious of the two boys raised as twins. While <a href="characters/Sam-Dogget-1742.html">Sam</a> was jollier and always ready to joke, Sep was more thoughtful and inclined toward reflection. He possessed a strong moral compass that set him apart from his brother, showing an instinctive respect for property despite having none himself. This internal sense of right and wrong made him reluctant to steal, even when Sam pressured him and rationalized the theft as harmless.</p>

<p>Sep was a dreamer with a romantic attachment to the Thames and its watermen. From the age of five, when his adoptive father told him (falsely) that Thomas Dogget of the famous Dogget's Coat and Badge Race was their "Uncle Tom," Sep developed a passionate identification with the river and its traditions. He had a clear sense of destiny and belonging, convinced he was part of a famous family line meant for life on the Thames rather than as a street vendor.</p>

<p>Despite his more serious nature, Sep was practical and capable, working alongside Sam at various odd jobs and errands to earn money they carefully hid from their gin-addicted mother. He was loyal to his brother and family, participating in the scheme to steal small amounts from Mrs Dogget to prevent the money from going to gin.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1742-birth-and-abandonment'>1742: Birth and Abandonment</h3>

<p>Sep was born George, Lord Bocton, to <a href="characters/Lady-St-James-1720.html">Lady St James</a> at their Hanover Square residence. His mother was horrified when she saw the infant had dark hair with a white streak and webbed fingers, screaming "It's not mine!" and believing the baby had been switched. Though assured by the doctor this was indeed her child, Lady St James found the physical abnormalities unbearable and could not contemplate showing such a child to fashionable society.</p>

<p>In a calculated plot, Lady St James enlisted a "shabby, green-eyed woman" from Covent Garden as an accomplice. She dismissed the wet-nurse, claimed the baby was sick, and trust no one but herself near the child. Days later, she staged a dramatic scene, rushing from the house with the baby wrapped in a shawl, insisting he needed country air. During a mad drive to the family estate at Bocton, she secretly exchanged her living son for a dead infant (obtained by her accomplice), then presented the corpse to the Rochester doctor as her own child who had just died.</p>

<p>The living baby was given to the green-eyed woman with instructions: "Do what you like. So long as I never see it again." The infant Lord Bocton was abandoned near Seven Dials in one of London's poorest neighborhoods.</p>

<h3 id='c-1742-found-by-harry-dogget'>c. 1742: Found by Harry Dogget</h3>

<p><a href="characters/Harry-Dogget-1710.html">Harry Dogget</a>, a costermonger, discovered the abandoned baby less than a month old near Seven Dials. Though he nearly passed by—abandoned babies being sadly common in Georgian London—Harry noticed the child seemed healthy. Upon examination, he was startled to discover the baby had a white streak in its hair like his own son Sam, and webbed hands like the Dogget family trait. Convinced by these hereditary markers that this must be his own illegitimate child (likely from an encounter with a woman at Covent Garden market), Harry took the baby home.</p>

<p>Mrs Dogget, already struggling with gin addiction and numerous children, accepted the story with humor: "I must've had twins, Harry. Just never noticed." The family raised him alongside Sam, and neighbors in Seven Dials knew better than to enquire too closely about children's origins. The local vicar, pleased the child had a home, suggested the name Septimus (Latin for "Seventh") since Harry found him by Seven Dials. The name quickly contracted to "Sep."</p>

<h3 id='1747-1750-childhood-in-seven-dials'>1747-1750: Childhood in Seven Dials</h3>

<p>Sep grew up in a crowded tenement courtyard near Seven Dials, raised as the twin brother of Sam. The boys were inseparable, working together at odd jobs and errands to earn money they hid from their mother (who would spend it on gin at the Needle and Pin). While Sam dreamed of being a prosperous costermonger with his own barrow, Sep developed different aspirations.</p>

<p>At age five, Harry took Sep to watch Dogget's Coat and Badge Race, the annual watermen's competition from London Bridge to Chelsea. When Sep asked if it was connected to their family, Harry cheerfully lied: "'Course it is. That was my old Uncle Tom." This moment transformed Sep's sense of identity. The river and its watermen acquired profound significance—he became convinced that Doggets truly belonged on the water, not selling goods from barrows. The glamorous Thames firemen (watermen employed by insurance companies) particularly captured his imagination, especially the Sun Insurance Company crews in their bright livery and leather helmets.</p>

<p>By age seven, Sep "knew where he belonged, in the bosom of the famous Dogget family; he knew his destiny, to be a fireman; he knew, already, almost all there was to know about the life of the London streets and his place in them."</p>

<h3 id='1750-the-sweeps-work-and-the-theft'>1750: The Sweep's Work and the Theft</h3>

<p>In May 1750, Sam devised a scheme to make money as chimney sweeps' assistants while stealing small items from the grand houses of Mayfair. They worked for a simple-minded sweep, being sent up chimneys while he worked two houses at once. The boys received extra tips by looking pitiful and claiming the sweep would whip them for being slow.</p>

<p>Sam saw the work as an opportunity for petty theft, advising Sep to take only small items that wouldn't be noticed—a silver coin rather than a golden guinea, an ivory comb, a gold button. Sep's moral instincts resisted this plan. Some deep principle within him insisted that "property must be respected, even though he himself had none." This may have been, the narrative suggests, "the ancient voice of the Bull ancestors of whose existence he was so profoundly ignorant".</p>

<p>After two weeks of Sam's complaints and pressure, Sep finally agreed to participate in the stealing. However, the scheme came to an abrupt end when Sam was caught stealing a shilling from the kitchen table at the Hanover Square residence of <a href="characters/Lady-St-James-1720.html">Lady St James</a>.</p>

<h3 id='1750-the-mistaken-identity-and-separation'>1750: The Mistaken Identity and Separation</h3>

<p>When Sam was caught by a footman and brought before Captain <a href="characters/Jack-Meredith-1722.html">Jack Meredith</a> and the lady of the house, he initially escaped but was recaptured when Meredith grabbed his hand. The captain noticed the webbed fingers and the white streak in the boy's hair, remarking "What an odd little fellow." Lady St James, confronted with these physical features, turned white as a ghost, realizing this was her abandoned son.</p>

<p>Though she initially refused to explain her shock to Meredith, she eventually confessed during a tortured night that she had given away her legitimate heir years before. Despite her reluctance—remembering the child's abnormalities with horror—Meredith insisted on moral principle: "I've killed the father. But I'm damned if I'll disinherit the child. If you don't take the child back, I will leave you."</p>

<p>Meredith tracked the boys to <a href="characters/Harry-Dogget-1710.html">Harry Dogget</a>, who told him how he'd found a baby with webbed hands and white-streaked hair by Seven Dials. Meredith identified the child by "the hands. And the hair. Remarkable." The boy caught stealing—Sam—was taken to Hanover Square and restored as the Earl of St James (having inherited the title when Lord St James died in a duel with Meredith earlier in 1750).</p>

<p>Harry Dogget later met with Sam on the corner and confirmed the irony of the situation: it was Sam who went into the house to steal, so it was Sam they found. "See, it was you that went into the house and tried to steal a shilling, right? So it was you they found." Harry's logic was impeccable even if the actual identity was wrong—fate had given Sam "a bit of a leg up in the world."</p>

<p>Sep remained with the Dogget family, never knowing the conversation had taken place or that his brother had been restored to an inheritance that was rightfully his own.</p>

<h3 id='1750s-onward-life-as-a-fireman'>1750s onward: Life as a Fireman</h3>

<p>Sep fulfilled his childhood dream and became a Thames fireman, working for one of the insurance companies (likely his beloved Sun Insurance Company, given his admiration for them as a child). He was "happy as a fireman, and, as he never realized he was owed a legacy, never missed it." The text notes that Sam, before being installed in his new life as a lord, told Harry to "Tell Sep he can have all my savings"—a final gesture of brotherhood.</p>

<p>Sep married twice during his life as a fireman. His second wife bore him a son, William Dogget (born c. 1795). Sep also had at least one other son from his first marriage, who would become William's elder half-brother.</p>

<h3 id='c-1798-death'>c. 1798: Death</h3>

<p>Sep Dogget died around 1798 when his son William was only three years old. He was killed when a blazing house collapsed while he was working as a fireman—dying in the line of duty in the profession he had dreamed of since childhood. His second wife was left to raise young William alone, though his elder half-brother from Sep's first marriage helped, "but not much, since he had his own children, including Silas, to care for."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='sam-dogget-earl-of-st-james'>Sam Dogget (Earl of St James)</h3>

<p>Raised as twins, Sep and Sam were inseparable throughout their childhood despite their different temperaments. Sam was the jollier and more mischievous, while Sep was more serious. The boys worked together on various schemes and errands, united in protecting their earnings from their mother's gin habit and cooperating in the sweep's business.</p>

<p>Their relationship was tested by Sam's persistent pressure on Sep to steal from the wealthy houses, which violated Sep's innate sense of property rights. Sep eventually gave in to his brother's cajoling, though reluctantly. When Sam was caught and mistakenly identified as the lost heir, the boys were permanently separated. Sam's parting gift was to leave Sep all his savings, showing the genuine affection beneath their different moral compasses.</p>

<p>The profound irony of their story is that it was Sam's character flaw—his willingness to steal—that led to his being caught and restored to the aristocratic life that actually belonged to Sep. Sep, whose honesty made him reluctant to steal, remained in the working-class life that should have been Sam's, never knowing what he'd lost.</p>

<h3 id='harry-dogget'>Harry Dogget</h3>

<p>Sep's adoptive father was a costermonger and street-seller who found Sep as an abandoned infant and raised him with genuine affection. Harry's belief that Sep was his own illegitimate son (based on the Dogget family's hereditary traits) meant he treated Sep as his natural child. Harry encouraged Sep's dreams of becoming a waterman and fireman, even fabricating a family connection to Thomas Dogget to fuel the boy's pride and ambition.</p>

<p>Harry's character combined street wisdom, basic decency, and a cheerful pragmatism. He couldn't leave a healthy baby to die in the streets, and he persuaded his gin-addicted wife to accept another child into their struggling household. When Captain Meredith came seeking the lost heir, Harry ensured the boy would have a good home before surrendering him—though as it turned out, he gave up the wrong twin.</p>

<h3 id='lady-st-james-biological-mother'>Lady St James (Biological Mother)</h3>

<p>Sep never knew his biological mother, and she never acknowledged him after abandoning him as an infant. Lady St James's rejection was absolute—she gave him away with instructions that she never see him again and hoped he was dead. Eight years later, when confronted with what she believed to be her abandoned son (actually Sam), she was horror-struck but eventually agreed to take him back under pressure from Meredith.</p>

<p>The relationship that never was represents one of the story's central tragedies: Sep was denied his birthright entirely because his mother found his physical appearance repugnant, and even when fate offered a chance at restoration, the wrong boy was returned.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Sep's story unfolds in 1742-1750s London during the Georgian era, a period of stark contrasts between aristocratic wealth and urban poverty. His childhood in Seven Dials placed him in one of London's most notorious slum areas, where poverty, crime, gin addiction, and abandoned children were endemic. The gin epidemic particularly devastated working-class families like the Doggets, with one in three babies dying before age six.</p>

<p>The Thames watermen and firemen that Sep aspired to join represented one of the few paths to respectability for working-class Londoners. These were skilled, physically demanding professions that offered decent wages and a measure of dignity. The insurance companies (like the Sun Insurance) employed watermen as firefighters because of their fitness and readiness—they wore company livery and leather helmets, creating a romantic image that captivated young Sep.</p>

<p>Dogget's Coat and Badge Race, established by comedian Thomas Dogget in 1715, was a genuine annual event that continues to this day, making it one of the world's oldest continuously contested sporting events. For Sep, it represented a family heritage that—ironically—he actually did possess through his adoptive father's line, even though Harry's claim of kinship to Thomas Dogget was likely false.</p>

<p>The contrast between Sep's life in Seven Dials and his biological family's Hanover Square mansion exemplified the vast gulf between social classes in Georgian London. That an Earl's heir could be abandoned and raised as a street urchin, while a costermonger's son could be elevated to the aristocracy, demonstrates both the rigid social stratification and the accidents of fate that could occasionally breach those barriers.</p>

<p>The story also reflects attitudes toward physical abnormalities and hereditary traits. Lady St James's horror at her son's webbed fingers and white-streaked hair was rooted in aristocratic concerns about appearance and lineage, while the Dogget family accepted these same traits as familiar markers of their own line.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Sep Dogget embodies several of the novel's central themes about identity, class, and the role of fate in shaping lives.</p>

<p><strong>True Identity vs. Social Identity</strong>: Sep's story asks profound questions about what makes someone who they are. Born Lord Bocton, raised as Sep Dogget, he lived his entire life unaware of his biological heritage. Yet he found happiness and fulfillment in the identity he chose for himself—a Thames fireman from the "famous Dogget family." His contentment suggests that chosen identity and lived experience matter more than accidents of birth. He belonged where he believed he belonged, on the river with the watermen, not in an aristocratic house in Hanover Square.</p>

<p><strong>The Arbitrariness of Inheritance and Social Station</strong>: The novel uses Sep's story to demonstrate how arbitrary social hierarchies can be. That a street urchin caught stealing should receive an inheritance rightfully belonging to his honest brother is a bitter irony. Sep, who had genuine moral scruples about theft, remained poor while Sam, who had none, became an earl. Neither boy chose their circumstances; fate, in the form of which one happened to be caught stealing, determined their destinies.</p>

<p><strong>Happiness Through Ignorance</strong>: Sep's contentment comes explicitly from not knowing what he lost: "as he never realized he was owed a legacy, never missed it." This raises questions about the relationship between knowledge and happiness. Would Sep have been better off knowing his true identity and claiming his inheritance? Or was his ignorance, combined with pursuing his genuine passion for the Thames and firefighting, the path to a more authentic life?</p>

<p><strong>Physical Heredity and Family Traits</strong>: The webbed fingers and white hair that run through the Dogget line—and which Sep inherited from his biological father's family—serve as both plot device and thematic element. These markers of heredity were simultaneously the cause of his abandonment (his mother's revulsion) and the cause of the later mix-up (allowing either twin to be identified as the heir). The novel suggests that physical heredity carries markers of identity that transcend social arrangements, yet social arrangements ultimately matter more than biology in determining one's life path.</p>

<p><strong>The Thames and London's Working Life</strong>: Sep's choice of becoming a Thames fireman connects him to one of London's enduring institutions. While his adoptive brother Sam became an earl, Sep joined the watermen who had plied the Thames for centuries, participating in traditions like Dogget's Coat and Badge Race. His story suggests that there is honor, tradition, and authentic belonging in working-class life that aristocratic titles cannot provide.</p>

<p><strong>Mothers and Rejection</strong>: Sep's abandonment by his biological mother, combined with his acceptance by his adoptive mother (despite her gin addiction and poverty), creates a complex portrait of motherhood. Mrs Dogget, struggling with addiction and too many children, could still joke "I must've had twins, Harry. Just never noticed" and accept another child. Lady St James, with all the resources of wealth, could not accept a child with physical differences. The contrast suggests that love and acceptance are not functions of social class or material resources.</p>

<p>Sep Dogget's story is ultimately one of the novel's more optimistic tales. Unlike his twin Sam, who was thrust into a life for which he had no preparation or particular aptitude, Sep lived the life he chose, pursuing his childhood dream of working on the river. That this contentment came from not knowing his true birth makes his story both ironic and poignant—a meditation on fate, identity, and the question of what constitutes a life well lived.</p>
