<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Simon is a conservative master armourer who follows the trade of his great-grandfather Alfred. A skilled craftsman proud of his work, he represents the respectable artisan class of London that exists below the wealthy wholesale merchants. His life is violently disrupted when young bloods from merchant families break into his house on coronation night, attacking him and murdering one of his apprentices, an event that exposes the class tensions simmering beneath London's surface.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Simon is described as a "short, sturdy master craftsman with the close-cropped brown beard and white patch in his hair." He is noted as being "strong as a blacksmith," wearing "a bright green tunic and green leggings" with "soft leather boots" that are red. His face becomes "as red as his soft leather boots" when angry, "puffed up with fury" so that "he looked like an indignant cockerel."</p>

<p>The white patch in his hair appears to be a hereditary trait, as it is also mentioned in connection with his great-grandfather Alfred's family line.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Simon is fundamentally a conservative man who takes pride in continuity and craftsmanship. He lives in the same house and follows the same craft as his great-grandfather Alfred, maintaining the family's artisan tradition across generations. He holds land strips in a hamlet near Windsor, paying rent in the traditional manner, and takes evident pride in his skill as a master craftsman.</p>

<p>His conservatism extends to his views on social hierarchy. He harbors resentment toward the wealthy wholesale merchants and aldermen who run London, seeing them as no better than craftsmen like himself despite their airs. "They never dirty their hands with work like we do," he observes. "They hardly ever touch their goods. Their children are too proud to work at all, half of them. Think they're nobles." His contempt is palpable: "But they aren't. They're just merchants, no better than me."</p>

<p>When wronged, Simon is a man of fierce determination. The break-in and murder of his apprentice both shocks and infuriates him, particularly because of the class contempt it demonstrates. His fury is righteous rather than vengeful – he seeks justice through proper channels, pursuing the culprits through the courts with the single-minded purpose of proving "They're no better than us. They're worse. They're just criminals."</p>

<p>Yet Simon also possesses a capacity for empathy that complicates his anger. Even as he watches the guilty young men face trial by ordeal and execution, knowing what punishment awaits them, he "could not help feeling a pang of remorse." He mutters, "They did a terrible thing. But even so. Poor devils." This moment of compassion reveals a fundamentally decent man beneath the outrage.</p>

<p>His confrontation with Pentecost Silversleeves demonstrates both his moral clarity and his controlled manner of expressing contempt. Rather than creating a scene, he approaches quietly and whispers devastating truths: "You're slime... You're a murderer too, as much as them. But you're worse. Because they're going to die and you aren't, Judas. You're too much of a coward." This measured cruelty is more chilling than any outburst.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='june-1170-the-attack'>June 1170: The Attack</h3>

<p>On the night following the coronation of the young prince (14 June 1170), Simon's household is violently invaded by a gang of young men from prominent London merchant families. These "young bloods" – including Pentecost Silversleeves and Henry Le Blond – are drunk and looking for mischief, intending to steal a baker's shirt as a trophy. However, in their inebriated state, they target the wrong house, breaking into Simon's residence instead.</p>

<p>Simon puts up a tremendous fight against the intruders, his strength as "strong as a blacksmith" and his professional familiarity with armor making him a formidable opponent. During the struggle, Simon's apprentice, a "wide-eyed boy with a knife," also attempts to defend the household. In the violence that follows, the apprentice is killed. The young men flee as the hue and cry is raised.</p>

<h3 id='the-pursuit-of-justice'>The Pursuit of Justice</h3>

<p>The following day, Simon bursts into the Exchequer chamber at Westminster Palace where the kingdom's most powerful officials are at work. His appearance is dramatic: wearing his bright green craftsman's clothing, his face red with fury, "puffed up" so he looks "like an indignant cockerel," he is accompanied by two large bailiffs. Before the assembled scribes, courtiers, and the grave figures at the Exchequer table – including the treasurer, the justiciar, and the Bishop of Winchester – Simon makes his accusation.</p>

<p>Pointing at Pentecost Silversleeves, he shouts: "There he is. That's the one. Seize him!" When the justiciar asks of what Silversleeves is accused, Simon's reply rings through the chamber: "Of murder."</p>

<p>This bold confrontation demonstrates both Simon's determination to seek justice and his understanding of how to navigate the system. By bringing his case directly to Westminster and confronting one of the perpetrators in front of the kingdom's most powerful officials, he ensures the matter cannot be quietly dismissed.</p>

<h3 id='the-trials'>The Trials</h3>

<p>King Henry II, already angry about the crime occurring on his son's coronation night, orders his personal representative to deal with the matter swiftly, stipulating that all the young men must be tried within three days. The culprits have all turned king's evidence and accused each other in hopes of leniency.</p>

<p>Simon attends the trials at Smithfield, where three of the young men face trial by ordeal – the test of being thrown bound into the horse pond. If they float, they are guilty; if they sink, innocent. All three float, proving their guilt in the eyes of medieval justice.</p>

<p>However, Pentecost Silversleeves escapes this fate by claiming benefit of clergy, being tried instead in the ecclesiastical court of Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of London. Despite the bishop's obvious contempt for the process, Silversleeves is acquitted through oath-swearing by corrupt witnesses, a miscarriage of justice that deeply offends Simon's sense of right and wrong.</p>

<h3 id='the-execution-and-confrontation'>The Execution and Confrontation</h3>

<p>Simon comes to Smithfield to witness the execution of the three guilty men, seeing it as his revenge and as justice served. Yet watching the proceedings troubles him. As the young men are stripped and prepared for hanging, Simon cannot help but feel "a pang of remorse," acknowledging their terrible crime while pitying them: "Poor devils."</p>

<p>It is at this moment that he spots Pentecost Silversleeves in the crowd. Rather than making a public scene, Simon carefully makes his way through the throng and approaches the young man who escaped justice. Sidling close until his beard brushes Silversleeves's ear, he whispers his judgement with quiet venom:</p>

<p>"You're slime. You know that, don't you? You're a murderer too, as much as them. But you're worse. Because they're going to die and you aren't, Judas. You're too much of a coward."</p>

<p>Simon watches Silversleeves stiffen at these words, whispers "Slime" once more, and then moves away. This private confrontation serves as Simon's personal justice against the man who escaped legal punishment.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='the-murdered-apprentice'>The Murdered Apprentice</h3>

<p>Simon's apprentice is described as a "wide-eyed boy with a knife" who attempts to defend against the intruders. The boy's murder is not merely a loss of property or labor to Simon, but a personal tragedy. He refers to the youth as his "favourite apprentice," indicating genuine affection and pride in the young man's development. The boy's death shocks and saddens Simon deeply, fueling his determination to see justice done.</p>

<h3 id='pentecost-silversleevespentecost-silversleeves-1145html'><a href="characters/Pentecost-Silversleeves-1145.html">Pentecost Silversleeves</a></h3>

<p>Simon's relationship with Pentecost is defined entirely by the attack and its aftermath. He identifies Pentecost as one of the attackers and publicly accuses him of murder at Westminster. When Pentecost escapes punishment through ecclesiastical privilege, Simon sees him as embodying the worst aspects of the merchant class: entitled, cowardly, and corrupt. His contemptuous confrontation at Smithfield – calling Silversleeves "slime," a "murderer," and "Judas" – expresses his moral revulsion at a system that protects the wealthy and privileged while punishing others. The epithet "Judas" is particularly significant, comparing Silversleeves to the ultimate traitor who betrayed innocence.</p>

<h3 id='king-henry-ii'>King Henry II</h3>

<p>Though Simon never directly interacts with the king, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry II</a> becomes an unexpected ally in Simon's pursuit of justice. The king's fury that such a crime should occur on his son's coronation night leads him to order swift trials and severe punishment. Henry refers to Simon as "my armourer," suggesting Simon may have done work for the crown, which could explain both his boldness in appearing at Westminster and the king's personal interest in the case. The king's later rage at encountering Silversleeves – demanding "Why weren't you hanged?" – vindicates Simon's position that this was indeed murder deserving death.</p>

<h3 id='great-grandfather-alfred'>Great-grandfather Alfred</h3>

<p>Though Alfred is long dead by 1170, Simon's relationship with his memory shapes his identity. Simon consciously lives "in the house and followed the craft of his great-grandfather, Alfred," maintaining continuity across generations. This connection to Alfred (who appears in earlier chapters of the book) grounds Simon in London's artisan tradition and informs his conservative values.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Simon exists at a pivotal moment in London's social development. The century since the Norman Conquest has seen the rise of wealthy wholesale merchants like <a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Sampson Bull</a> and the Silversleeves family, who have accumulated considerable wealth and political power as aldermen controlling the city's wards. These merchant princes increasingly distance themselves from actual craft work, their children "too proud to work at all."</p>

<p>Below them in the social hierarchy are master craftsmen like Simon – skilled, respectable, property-owning men who nonetheless "dirty their hands with work." They are far from the poorest Londoners, but equally far from the aldermen who wield real power. Simon's holding of land strips near Windsor and his status as a master craftsman place him in this middling position.</p>

<p>The attack on Simon's household epitomizes the class tensions of the period. The young merchant bloods treat craftsmen's homes as targets for their "pranks," demonstrating a contempt that Simon accurately identifies as class-based. That these youths feel entitled to break into a craftsman's home and steal his property as a "trophy" speaks to their sense of superiority. The murder of the apprentice is almost accidental, a byproduct of this contemptuous attitude.</p>

<p>The trial and its outcome further illuminate these tensions. The three young men without connections are swiftly tried by ordeal and executed. But Pentecost Silversleeves, from a wealthy merchant family, escapes through benefit of clergy – a privilege theoretically based on religious status but practically available primarily to the educated class, which meant the wealthy. Even Gilbert Foliot, the aristocratic Bishop of London, finds the proceeding distasteful, but the system protects Silversleeves nonetheless.</p>

<p>Simon's confrontation at Westminster is therefore not merely about personal justice but about challenging the notion that merchants are "nobles" above the law. His insistence on publicly naming Silversleeves as a murderer in front of the kingdom's most powerful men is an assertion of equal treatment under law, a radical claim in feudal society.</p>

<p>The broader historical context of 1170 also matters. This is the period of Henry II's judicial reforms, when the king is attempting to establish royal courts with impartial justice as an alternative to unreliable feudal courts. Simon's case becomes caught up in the parallel conflict between royal and ecclesiastical justice, the very issue over which Henry is fighting with Thomas Becket. The fact that a craftsman can appeal directly to royal justice and receive a hearing demonstrates both the new possibilities and the limitations of Henry's reforms.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Simon represents the respectable artisan class of medieval London – skilled, proud, and increasingly aware of their subordinate position in the social hierarchy. His story illustrates the class tensions developing in the growing commercial city, where wealthy merchant families are creating a new aristocracy but craftsmen like Simon maintain that "they're just merchants, no better than me."</p>

<p>The attack on his household and murder of his apprentice serve as a catalyst for exploring medieval justice. Simon's case demonstrates both the strengths and weaknesses of the legal system: the speed and severity of trial by ordeal for common criminals, the escape hatch of benefit of clergy for the educated classes, and the ability of wealthy families to corrupt even ecclesiastical justice through oath-swearing by compromised witnesses.</p>

<p>Simon's character embodies a particular kind of English conservatism – a respect for tradition, craft, and continuity combined with a blunt insistence on fairness and equal treatment. His contempt for social pretension ("Think they're nobles. But they aren't") and his determination to pursue justice through proper channels while maintaining his own moral clarity make him a representative of artisan values.</p>

<p>The contrast between Simon's physical courage during the attack and his moral courage in pursuing justice through the courts underscores the medieval craftsman's complex position – powerful in his own domain, yet limited in his ability to challenge the merchant elite who increasingly control the city.</p>

<p>His moment of compassion at the executions – feeling remorse even for the men who killed his apprentice – reveals the human complexity beneath social tensions. Simon can simultaneously believe justice requires execution and feel pity for the condemned, embodying the medieval Christian tension between judgment and mercy.</p>

<p>Finally, Simon's story intersects with the larger historical drama of church-state conflict. His case becomes ammunition in the fight over criminous clerks, the issue that poisons relations between Henry II and Thomas Becket. That a craftsman's murdered apprentice should become a flashpoint in a constitutional crisis demonstrates how personal tragedies and grand historical forces intertwine in Rutherford's London.</p>
