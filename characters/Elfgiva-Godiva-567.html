<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Elfgiva is a high-born Anglo-Saxon noblewoman from East Anglia, wife of the wealthy merchant <a href="characters/Cerdic-555.html">Cerdic</a> and mother of four grown sons. The chapter centers on a profound marital and spiritual crisis when her husband demands she convert to Christianity alongside him and their sons, threatening to replace her with a younger wife if she refuses. Her story explores the conflict between loyalty to ancestral pagan gods and the demands of marriage, the precarious position of even high-born women in Anglo-Saxon society, and ultimately her difficult choice between pride and pragmatism. Her conversion and reconciliation with her husband form the emotional heart of the narrative.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Elfgiva is described as a fine-looking woman at age 37. She has a fair complexion, a handsome face, and bright blue eyes. Her hair is golden, though strands of silver have begun to appear. She is noted as "still a fine-looking woman" despite approaching middle age. Her richly embroidered hunting dress proclaims her status as a noblewoman. Her appearance reflects her East Anglian heritage – the fair-haired, blue-eyed characteristics of the Anglo-Saxon people.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Elfgiva is proud, brave, and deeply principled, but also torn between competing loyalties. Her household servants admire her courage and pride, noting "she's brave" and "she's proud." She demonstrates compassion and mercy when she encounters the young couple <a href="characters/Offa-584.html">Offa</a> and <a href="characters/Ricola-589.html">Ricola</a> about to be executed, impulsively purchasing them as slaves to save their lives.</p>

<p>She is deeply attached to her ancestral pagan faith, particularly the gods of her East Anglian heritage. Her father was a bold seafarer who traveled the northern seas and married a Swedish bride, and Elfgiva maintains strong ties to this wild, free coastal culture. She makes annual pilgrimages to her father's burial mound to draw strength from his memory.</p>

<p>Despite her strong will, Elfgiva experiences profound uncertainty and indecision during the crisis. She is caught between her loyalty to her pagan gods, her love for her husband of twenty-five years, her maternal feelings, and her sense of dignity and self-respect. The text describes her as "teetering on a riverbank, unable to make up her mind whether to jump into the stream."</p>

<p>She possesses a sense of fatalism typical of Anglo-Saxon culture, believing in <em>wyrd</em> (destiny). She feels an "instinctive sense of foreboding" as she returns home, trusting that destiny will decree what happens when she meets her husband.</p>

<p>Elfgiva also demonstrates class consciousness – even in her distress, she confides in her slave Ricola, but ultimately views the girl as beneath her notice as a romantic rival, dismissing her as merely "a chattel to be used for the night."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-marriage-c-579'>Early Life and Marriage (c. 579)</h3>

<p>Elfgiva came from East Anglia, from a family of seafarers. Her father was a bold traveler who sailed the northern seas and took a Swedish bride. When he died, he was buried in his boat in full regalia in a burial mound on the East Anglian coast. Elfgiva married <a href="characters/Cerdic-555.html">Cerdic</a>, a wealthy Saxon merchant and landowner from Kent, in what became a happy marriage lasting a quarter-century. They established residences both at Cerdic's ancestral Kentish estate at Bocton and at the trading post of Lundenwic on the Thames. Together they had four sons.</p>

<h3 id='september-604-the-crisis-begins'>September 604: The Crisis Begins</h3>

<p>Elfgiva travels to East Anglia for her annual visit to her father's grave, a three-day journey to the wild coastal region of her childhood. This time she seeks strength for a terrible decision. Her husband, having recently converted to Christianity at the request of King Ethelbert of Kent, has demanded that she and their sons also be baptized when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellitus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bishop Mellitus</a> returns to preach at Lundenwic. After twenty-five years of happy marriage, this religious conflict has driven them apart.</p>

<p>On her return journey, Elfgiva comes upon a hidden hamlet where the young couple Offa and Ricola are about to be executed for fornication – the girl to be drowned in a sack with an adder, the man to be made an outlaw. Moved by their youth and love, and perhaps seeing her own troubles as less terrible by comparison, Elfgiva impulsively purchases them both as slaves with a gold coin, saving their lives. She brings them back to Lundenwic to serve her household.</p>

<h3 id='the-ultimatum'>The Ultimatum</h3>

<p>Two days after his return, Cerdic delivers a devastating ultimatum to Elfgiva in private: "If you will not obey me, then I am going to take another wife... Instead of you." He demands she be baptized with their sons when the bishop returns, or he will replace her entirely. Under Anglo-Saxon law, he has this right – Elfgiva "belonged to her husband. She had been paid for."</p>

<p>Cerdic has already visited an estate near Bocton and arranged with a fellow landowner for his fifteen-year-old daughter Edith to marry either Cerdic himself (if he puts away Elfgiva) or Cerdic's eldest son (if he does not). The girl is "a nice, sensible and pretty young Saxon who liked the ordered life of Kent" and has agreed to be baptized.</p>

<h3 id='the-household-in-limbo'>The Household in Limbo</h3>

<p>Elfgiva neither accepts nor refuses immediately. As weeks pass, a strange atmosphere descends on the household. Though technically still Cerdic's wife, people begin treating her "as though she had already left." She feels like "a guest in my own home... one who's starting to stay too long." She confides to her slave Ricola: "I know my husband. He's a cautious merchant. He'll divorce me as soon as he has the new girl in his hands. Not before."</p>

<p>Her four sons react differently. The three eldest commiserate but ultimately side with their father, fearing him more than they love her. Only sixteen-year-old <a href="characters/Wistan-588.html">Wistan</a> supports her completely, breaking down with grief and vowing he cannot accept the situation.</p>

<h3 id='wistans-intervention'>Wistan's Intervention</h3>

<p>Without telling anyone, Wistan secretly rides to the estate near Bocton where Edith lives. He intercepts the fifteen-year-old girl in the woods and tells her everything about the situation, pleading with her not to come. Though Wistan finds her surprisingly beautiful and intelligent, his mission succeeds – Edith changes her mind and refuses the marriage.</p>

<p>When word reaches Cerdic, he instantly guesses Wistan's involvement. In an apoplexy of fury, he seizes a stock whip and beats the boy, who flees. Wistan wisely stays out of sight for days while his father's rage gradually subsides. However, rather than pursue Edith further, Cerdic decides it would be undignified to insist on a marriage with "a young girl who, it seemed, was already capable of giving trouble."</p>

<p>After this failure, Cerdic makes one final attempt at reconciliation. He tells Elfgiva that if she will follow the example of her sons and be baptized, he will end his search for a new wife and take her back. She refuses again, unable to surrender her pride and dignity even when given this opportunity.</p>

<h3 id='the-bishops-return-and-the-yuletide-feast'>The Bishop's Return and the Yuletide Feast</h3>

<p>In late December, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellitus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bishop Mellitus</a> returns unexpectedly to Lundenwic during the Saxon Yuletide celebrations. On Saturday, he leads the entire household and local population up to the ruined city to the site of his future cathedral of St Paul's. There he delivers a moving sermon in poetic Anglo-Saxon about Christ as a young hero-god, like the beloved god Frey, who sacrificed himself on the Rood (cross) to offer eternal life to all people, even slaves.</p>

<p>Mellitus emphasizes forgiveness and reconciliation: "If you have quarrelled with your neighbour, your servant or your wife, go now and make amends. Forgive them and beg their pardon in turn. Do not think of yourself. Be ready to sacrifice your own desires."</p>

<p>The sermon profoundly moves Elfgiva. Despite her long resistance, she finds herself touched by the promise of "a love that could comfort sufferers such as she." She hesitates at the baptism, and Bishop Mellitus, remembering their earlier unhappy encounter, tells Cerdic: "I shall baptize your wife, my friend, when she comes to me with a good heart. When she desires it – as I hope she will – and not before. You must show Christian charity, Cerdic. Then she will obey you willingly."</p>

<h3 id='ricolas-plan-and-the-yuletide-night'>Ricola's Plan and the Yuletide Night</h3>

<p>On the eve of the shortest day (<em>Modranecht</em> – mothers' night), Ricola the slave girl executes a desperate plan to reconcile her master and mistress. She deliberately places herself in Cerdic's path late in the evening, allowing him to pursue her while sending Offa to fetch Elfgiva. The plan is to make Elfgiva see her husband pursuing another woman, forcing her to decide on the spot whether to reclaim him or lose him.</p>

<p>The plan goes awry. When Elfgiva finally emerges from the hall, she finds Cerdic kissing the slave girl, but her reaction is not what Ricola expected. As a high-born lady, Elfgiva views the slave as beneath her notice – "not a rival, hardly even an embarrassment... a chattel to be used for the night." She dismisses the scene with cold contempt and returns to the feast.</p>

<p>Cerdic proceeds to spend the night with Ricola, to the anguish of Offa. Ricola, already carrying Offa's child, submits to the merchant, unable to resist and now fearful for her future.</p>

<h3 id='the-dawn-decision'>The Dawn Decision</h3>

<p>Elfgiva lies awake all night, tormented by regret. She realizes: "He was yours, and you turned him away." She questions whether her loyalty to her pagan gods has brought her any comfort during this winter night and concludes they have not. Before dawn, she walks to the river's edge and sits on the jetty in the darkness, wrestling with her decision.</p>

<p>As the water turns from black to grey, she stands up, straightens her shoulders, and makes her choice. She will take control of her marriage again.</p>

<p>That morning, Elfgiva tells Cerdic firmly: "I will follow your new god. Tell your priest he can baptize me." However, she adds one condition: "The slave girl goes." Cerdic embraces her and agrees: "Whatever you want. After all, she belongs to you."</p>

<h3 id='the-slave-ship-and-mercy'>The Slave Ship and Mercy</h3>

<p>Cerdic arranges to sell Ricola and Offa to a Frisian slave-trader who has opportunely arrived. The couple is chained with northern slaves bound for the Continent. As the boat prepares to leave, Ricola desperately screams that she is pregnant, hoping Elfgiva will hear and take pity.</p>

<p>Elfgiva does hear. What brings her down to the jetty is not only Ricola's cry but also "the something that had passed between husband and wife in Cerdic's hall that mothers' night, the tiny seed of joy in that long midwinter night." Recognizing a kindred condition in Ricola, and perhaps softened by her own renewed hope, Elfgiva stops the departure. She frees both Ricola and Offa, giving them back their freedom but banishing them from Lundenwic forever.</p>

<h3 id='spring-605-baptism-and-new-life'>Spring 605: Baptism and New Life</h3>

<p>By February, Elfgiva becomes certain she has conceived, believing it happened on <em>Modranecht</em>. She privately believes the child will be a girl – the daughter she has always longed for.</p>

<p>In April, at the festival of <em>Eostre</em> (Easter), Bishop Mellitus returns to supervise construction of the modest cathedral of St Paul's. Watched by her sons and led by her husband, Elfgiva is baptized in the little River Fleet. The bishop gives her a new Christian name: "And since your name, Elfgiva, means 'Gift of the Faeries,' I shall baptize you with a new name. Henceforth you shall be called Godiva, which means 'Gift of God'."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='cerdiccerdic-555html'><a href="characters/Cerdic-555.html">Cerdic</a></h3>

<p>Elfgiva's relationship with her husband is the central dynamic of the chapter. After twenty-five years of happy marriage, they fall into sudden and bitter conflict over religion. Cerdic is described as "strong as a bull, but hard as an oak tree," a man of absolute principles who sees issues in "black and white." Once he converts to Christianity, he believes his wife's duty is clear: she must convert as well. To him, her refusal is disloyal and inexplicable.</p>

<p>Despite the crisis, deep bonds remain between them. Servants note, "She's brave, but can she hold out?" "Not against the master. He always gets his way." Yet there is also admiration: "All those who knew her husband would have agreed, 'She may be brave, but no one gets the better of Cerdic.'"</p>

<p>During their separation, Cerdic's frustration grows. He looks for a younger wife not necessarily because he wants one, but because he feels Elfgiva has left him no choice. "I should have married a girl like that in the first place," he thinks about Edith. "She'd never have given me trouble like Elfgiva, from her wild East Anglian shores." Yet when plans for the new marriage collapse, "he secretly missed the comfort of his old marriage."</p>

<p>The reconciliation on <em>Modranecht</em> is portrayed as a homecoming for both: "the merchant experienced a sense of homecoming, and as for Elfgiva, it seemed to her in the depths of that long night that something had opened again within her. Something wonderful and mysterious. The next morning, she awoke with a quiet and special smile."</p>

<h3 id='wistanwistan-588html'><a href="characters/Wistan-588.html">Wistan</a></h3>

<p>Of her four sons, only the youngest, sixteen-year-old Wistan, shows complete loyalty to his mother. When she is rejected, the three eldest "commiserate" but ultimately side with their father, fearing him more than they love her. Elfgiva mourns: "They fear their father more than they love me. And I do believe they probably love hunting slightly more than they love their own mother."</p>

<p>But Wistan is different. He breaks down with grief when speaking to her and becomes "so upset with his father that she had had to urge him for her sake not to enrage Cerdic further by attacking him." When Wistan confronts his father on the path to demand he stop mistreating his mother, Cerdic bellows at him and knocks him aside. Yet secretly, Cerdic thinks: "But that boy's the best of the lot."</p>

<p>Wistan's secret journey to persuade Edith not to marry his father is an act of profound loyalty, even though he knows it will provoke his father's fury. He endures a savage whipping and must hide for days, but his intervention ultimately helps create the conditions for his parents' reconciliation.</p>

<h3 id='ricolaricola-589html-and-offaoffa-584html'><a href="characters/Ricola-589.html">Ricola</a> and <a href="characters/Offa-584.html">Offa</a></h3>

<p>Elfgiva's relationship with her slaves is complex and revealing of her character. She saves their lives on impulse when she encounters them about to be executed, moved by their youth and love. She pays a gold coin – a fortune to the villagers – without hesitation.</p>

<p>During the crisis with Cerdic, Ricola becomes a confidante. "Although Elfgiva was usually reticent and dignified, occasionally, in her loneliness, she stooped to sharing a confidence with the slave girl." Ricola sits with her on nights when tears run down Elfgiva's face. She hides young Wistan when he flees his father's rage.</p>

<p>Yet Elfgiva's class consciousness remains absolute. When she sees Cerdic kissing Ricola, she dismisses the scene with contempt because, to her, the slave is "not a rival" – merely "a chattel to be used for the night if her husband had nothing better to do." She can "dismiss her from her mind just as she wished."</p>

<p>Only when Elfgiva hears Ricola screaming that she's pregnant – and when Elfgiva herself has just conceived – does compassion return. The "tiny seed of joy" from her own <em>Modranecht</em> reconciliation causes her to "take pity on poor Ricola and her husband." She stops their sale and grants them freedom, though she still banishes them from Lundenwic, showing mercy but maintaining distance.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Elfgiva's story unfolds at a pivotal moment in English history: the Christianization of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the early seventh century. In 597, Pope Gregory I sent the monk Augustine to Britain, and King Ethelbert of Kent became the first Anglo-Saxon king to convert to Christianity. By 604, Bishop Mellitus had been appointed to establish a cathedral at London (the future St Paul's), and the new religion was spreading through the Saxon kingdoms.</p>

<p>The conflict between Elfgiva's pagan heritage and the demands of Christianity reflects the broader religious transformation occurring across Anglo-Saxon England. The missionaries employed a strategy of absorption rather than destruction: "Do not destroy what is already entrenched. Absorb it." Mellitus deliberately comes to preach at Yuletide, converting the pagan midwinter festival into a Christian celebration. His sermon deliberately uses Anglo-Saxon poetic forms and compares Christ to Frey, a beloved pagan god, making Christianity more palatable to his audience.</p>

<p>Elfgiva embodies the older pagan worldview. She believes in <em>wyrd</em> (destiny), the "unknowable" fate that governs all things. She reveres Woden, Thunor, Tiw, and Frigg – gods whose names survive in the days of the week. Her father's boat burial reflects Scandinavian pagan customs. The "bleak, harsh gods of her Nordic heritage" offer no comfort in suffering, only fatalistic acceptance.</p>

<p>Her legal position reflects the subordinate status of women in Anglo-Saxon society, even high-born ones. "The laws of the Anglo-Saxons concerning women were simple. Elfgiva belonged to her husband. She had been paid for." Cerdic could legally take additional wives or replace her entirely. Yet the text notes, "This was not to say that all Saxon women were downtrodden. Elfgiva knew some wives who ruled their husbands entirely." Women could exercise power through personality and will, but the law remained firmly on the husband's side.</p>

<p>The slave trade was a major part of the Anglo-Saxon economy. The slaves in the story come from various sources: war captives from Northumbria's raids on the Scots, criminals like Offa and Ricola, and people sold by their own families due to poverty. The Frisian traders transported them across the Channel to be sold throughout Europe. Pope Gregory himself had famously seen fair-haired English slaves in Rome and pronounced, "They are not Angles, but angels" – a comment that reportedly inspired him to send missionaries to Britain.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<h3 id='the-conflict-between-faith-and-family'>The Conflict Between Faith and Family</h3>

<p>Elfgiva's story dramatizes the human cost of religious conversion. Her crisis is not theological – she never questions Christianity's truth – but deeply personal. Converting means betraying her father's memory, abandoning the gods of her ancestors, and surrendering to her husband's demands. Not converting means losing her marriage, her home, her sons, and her identity. There is no easy choice.</p>

<p>The narrative treats both her pagan faith and her resistance with respect. Her loyalty to ancestral gods is not portrayed as ignorance or superstition but as genuine piety. At the same time, Christianity offers something her old faith does not: comfort in suffering, hope beyond death for common people (not just heroes), and a divine love that embraces even slaves.</p>

<h3 id='pride-dignity-and-survival'>Pride, Dignity, and Survival</h3>

<p>Elfgiva's struggle centers on pride. Can she surrender to her husband's ultimatum without losing her self-respect? Even when he offers reconciliation after the Edith debacle, she refuses: "If he would only beg me... If he would only show tenderness, even a little regret. But he left her there, like some poor animal tethered and forgotten in a storm."</p>

<p>Yet pride alone brings only isolation. The household begins treating her as already departed. Her sons (except Wistan) prioritize their father's approval. She has nowhere to go – her brother is distant, her Kentish relatives non-existent. Survival requires compromise, but at what cost to dignity?</p>

<p>The resolution is complex. Elfgiva's conversion comes not from fear alone but from multiple factors: Bishop Mellitus's moving sermon that touches her heart, Wistan's sacrifice on her behalf, the jealousy provoked by seeing Cerdic with Ricola, and the long night of reflection when she realizes her pagan gods offer no comfort. Her final decision reflects agency – she chooses to "take control of her marriage again" – but also accommodation to reality.</p>

<h3 id='womens-power-and-powerlessness'>Women's Power and Powerlessness</h3>

<p>The chapter explores the paradox of women's position in Anglo-Saxon society. Legally, Elfgiva is property. Cerdic can replace her at will. Yet she has considerable informal power: she manages the household, commands servants, and for months successfully resists her husband despite his threats. The household admires her courage. Even Cerdic watches her directing operations during the bishop's visit "with quiet admiration."</p>

<p>Her power, however, depends entirely on her husband's goodwill. Once he withdraws it, her position collapses. She cannot turn to her sons, who side with their father. She has no legal recourse, no property of her own, nowhere to go. Her only remaining weapons are passive resistance and the hope that Cerdic will relent.</p>

<p>The character of Ricola provides a contrast. As a slave, she has even less legal standing than Elfgiva, yet she acts with remarkable agency and courage. Her scheme to reconcile the couple shows initiative, even if it backfires. Yet Elfgiva's class-based dismissal of Ricola as a romantic rival reveals the limits of female solidarity across social boundaries.</p>

<h3 id='mercy-and-new-life'>Mercy and New Life</h3>

<p>The chapter's resolution emphasizes mercy and renewal. Elfgiva's conversion coincides with conception – both a spiritual and biological new beginning. Her baptismal name, Godiva ("Gift of God"), replaces Elfgiva ("Gift of the Faeries"), marking her transformation from pagan to Christian.</p>

<p>Her mercy toward Ricola and Offa, after initially selling them into slavery, reflects her own transformed condition. Having experienced the "tiny seed of joy" of her <em>Modranecht</em> reconciliation, she responds to Ricola's pregnancy with compassion rather than vengeance. She grants them freedom, though she still banishes them – mercy tempered by class consciousness.</p>

<p>The chapter ends at <em>Eostre</em> (Easter), the festival of resurrection and spring, after the darkness of midwinter. Elfgiva's story moves from autumn despair through winter crisis to spring rebirth, mirroring the Christian narrative of death and resurrection that Bishop Mellitus preaches.</p>
