<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Joan Fleming is a fifteen-year-old craftsman's daughter who makes an extraordinary sacrifice to save her fiancé <a href="characters/Martin-Fleming-1277.html">Martin Fleming</a> from hanging. When Martin is condemned to death for robbery, Joan temporarily registers as a prostitute at the Dog's Head brothel on Bankside, using an obscure legal provision that allows a prostitute to claim a condemned man as her husband and secure his release. Her story demonstrates both the vulnerability of young women in medieval London and the remarkable courage that love could inspire.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Joan is described as "a neat little person" at age fifteen. She has brown hair that she pulls back carefully to reveal an oval face. Her skin is pale and very smooth. Her hands and feet are small and "a little fleshy," hinting at the modest plumpness of her body, which men often found attractive. Her most distinctive feature is her quiet, rather solemn eyes, which reveal her serious nature.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Joan possesses a quietly determined character beneath her modest exterior. She is fundamentally decent and pure, having never been kissed before meeting Martin. Unlike other girls who laugh at the awkward young apprentice, Joan treats him with genuine kindness and respect. Her calm, serious eyes and quiet demeanor make her seem mature beyond her fifteen years.</p>

<p>Her defining characteristic is her extraordinary courage when it comes to protecting those she loves. When faced with Martin's impending execution, she agrees to the Dogget sisters' daring plan despite her profound discomfort with the idea of becoming a prostitute, even temporarily. The depth of her sacrifice is evident in her distress throughout the ordeal - she is described as being in "floods of tears" when the Dogget sisters first find her outside St Paul's.</p>

<p>Joan demonstrates both practical intelligence and emotional strength. She understands the risks of the plan but is willing to endure public shame and family rejection to save Martin's life. Her willingness to kiss <a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a> and walk with him to the bridge shows her ability to overcome her natural modesty when necessary. The fact that she goes pale at the prospect of actually having to service a customer reveals her genuine innocence, while her determination to see the plan through anyway shows her moral courage.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1295-courtship-with-martin-fleming'>1295: Courtship with Martin Fleming</h3>

<p>Joan first meets <a href="characters/Martin-Fleming-1277.html">Martin Fleming</a> when she is about fourteen years old, working in or near her father's saddle-painting workshop at the bottom of Bread Street. Martin, an apprentice horner who has been rejected and mocked by other girls for being puny and awkward, finds in Joan someone who does not find him ridiculous. Her calm, serious eyes make him feel manly, and importantly, there are no other suitors competing for her attention.</p>

<p>Their courtship is tender and devoted. Martin brings her little presents regularly and matches her moods - comforting her when sad, sharing her happiness when she is joyful. No one has ever paid her such attention before, and within six months they both wish to marry. However, there is a significant problem: neither family has much money to give. Joan's father, a decent but modest craftsman, can only provide a small dowry, and Martin's father, a horner, has even less. After the two fathers meet, they reach an agreement that the young couple must wait two years in hopes that Martin might improve his position. Joan's father secretly hopes they might "change their minds" during this waiting period.</p>

<h3 id='1295-martins-arrest'>1295: Martin's Arrest</h3>

<p>Disaster strikes when Martin violates the curfew laws of London. One night, after drinking too much at a tavern with friends, Martin remains out after the church bells have tolled curfew. While making his way home through the dark streets, he is set upon by footpads (street robbers). In the ensuing scuffle, Martin manages to grab a purse from one of the attackers. Unfortunately, the purse belongs to an Italian Lombard moneylender, a member of a protected class of foreign merchants.</p>

<p>Martin is arrested and thrown into Newgate Prison. The case is serious - robbery of a foreigner is a capital offense, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Edward I</a> is known to be particularly protective of his foreign merchants. Martin is condemned to hang, with no realistic possibility of pardon. A poor apprentice has no resources to buy royal clemency, and even his friends and family lack the connections or money to help.</p>

<h3 id='1295-the-desperate-plan'>1295: The Desperate Plan</h3>

<p>In her despair, Joan is found "in floods of tears" outside St Paul's by <a href="characters/Isobel-Dogget-1270.html">Isobel Dogget</a> and <a href="characters/Margery-Dogget-1270.html">Margery Dogget</a>, two warm-hearted prostitutes from the Bankside stews. When the sisters learn Joan's story, they are intrigued and immediately want to help. They devise an extraordinary plan based on an obscure medieval law: if a woman registered as a prostitute claims a condemned man at the gallows as her husband, the authorities may release him to her.</p>

<p>The plan requires Joan to temporarily become a registered prostitute at the Dog's Head brothel on Bankside. She must be properly registered with the Bishop of Winchester's bailiff and spend at least one night in the brothel before claiming Martin at his execution. The Dogget sisters promise to protect her from actually having to service any customers, assuring her they can get her through the ordeal untouched.</p>

<p>Joan, despite her profound reservations and natural modesty, agrees to the plan. The dishonor of appearing even once as a registered prostitute is enough to brand her for life, but she loves Martin enough to endure this shame. Her main worry is that if the authorities discover she never actually worked as a prostitute, they might invalidate her claim on Martin.</p>

<h3 id='1295-the-dogs-head'>1295: The Dog's Head</h3>

<p>Joan arrives at the Dog's Head, a middling-sized brothel with red-painted plaster and a large sign depicting a dog's head with a huge tongue. The brothelkeeper is a large, balding man with a greasy black beard; his wife is a square woman with a broad, yellowish face that reminds Joan of "a sweating cheese." From her small attic room in the gable of the house, Joan can see across the Thames to the rooftops and even glimpse the top of Newgate Prison, where Martin is held. This view provides her some comfort during her ordeal.</p>

<p>The Dogget sisters arrange for Joan to wear their professional garb and be registered, planning to keep customers away from her until the following day when she can claim Martin at the gallows. However, complications arise almost immediately. The brothelkeeper and his wife, seeing an opportunity for profit from a virgin, break their promise and try to sell Joan's virginity to the highest bidder before the agreed-upon time.</p>

<h3 id='1295-william-bulls-intervention'>1295: William Bull's Intervention</h3>

<p><a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a>, a wealthy but recently politically defeated merchant, arrives at the Dog's Head after hearing rumors of a virgin. He has paid the brothelkeeper for the privilege of taking Joan's virginity and is led up to her attic room. However, Joan angrily confronts the brothelkeeper about breaking his promise that she would have no customers until the next day.</p>

<p>In the confusion, <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a>, Bull's political enemy and a wealthy alderman, also appears, having heard the same rumors. The two powerful men nearly come to blows over who has the right to the girl. In desperation, Joan tells Bull the truth about her plan to save Martin Fleming from hanging.</p>

<p>Remarkably, Bull believes her story and is moved by her courage and devotion. Despite having paid for her services, he chooses not to touch her. Instead, he promises to help her claim Martin at the gallows and, if that fails, to ride to Westminster and try to secure a royal pardon. To maintain appearances and protect her from Barnikel and others, Joan publicly kisses Bull and walks with him to London Bridge, making it appear that he has indeed enjoyed her company.</p>

<h3 id='1295-the-silversleeves-crisis'>1295: The Silversleeves Crisis</h3>

<p>That evening, after curfew has sounded, another complication arises. <a href="characters/Dionysius-Silversleeves-1266.html">Dionysius Silversleeves</a>, an arrogant and wealthy young man from the Royal Mint, arrives at the brothel demanding the virgin he has heard about. When told she is unavailable, he becomes angry and insistent, drinking heavily while waiting.</p>

<p>The Dogget sisters devise an elaborate trick to protect Joan's virginity. In the darkness of the brothel (the lantern having conveniently gone out due to the strong wind), and with Silversleeves drunk and disoriented, they execute a substitution. While Silversleeves believes he is with Joan, it is actually Margery Dogget who shares his bed that night. Joan hides under a blanket in the corner of the attic room, holding her breath until the drunken Silversleeves falls asleep. The ruse succeeds perfectly, and the sisters later rock with laughter at the deception.</p>

<h3 id='1295-the-gallows-at-newgate'>1295: The Gallows at Newgate</h3>

<p>The next morning, a crowd gathers outside Newgate Prison to watch the hanging of five thieves, including Martin Fleming. Joan arrives wearing the required striped garment of a registered prostitute. The tumbrel (cart) is ready to carry the condemned men to the hanging trees at Smithfield. Joan's father and two brothers are also present, their faces grave and stern.</p>

<p>When Martin is brought out, Joan publicly claims him as the law allows, announcing that she is a registered prostitute and wishes to marry him. However, a devastating complication arises: <a href="characters/Dionysius-Silversleeves-1266.html">Dionysius Silversleeves</a>, who has arrived by chance and witnessed the scene, publicly exposes that Joan was never actually with him the previous night - he had been tricked. The King's justice questions whether Joan is truly a prostitute if she has never actually served a customer.</p>

<p>To make matters infinitely worse, Martin Fleming himself, learning for the first time exactly what Joan has done to try to save him, is so horrified by the idea of his pure fiancée becoming a prostitute that he publicly rejects her. "I don't want her," he declares, unable to overcome his shock and disgust at what she has done, even to save his life. The tumbrel begins to move toward Smithfield with Martin aboard, still condemned to hang.</p>

<p>Joan screams and tries to run after the cart, but her father and brothers hold her back. "It's over," they tell her, and she faints from the emotional trauma of having sacrificed everything - her reputation, her family's honor, her future - only to be rejected by the very man she tried to save.</p>

<h3 id='1295-the-royal-pardon'>1295: The Royal Pardon</h3>

<p><a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a>, true to his word, immediately rides to Westminster Palace where Parliament is in session. He finds the Warden of London speaking with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Edward I</a> himself and dares to interrupt, begging for a royal pardon for Martin Fleming. However, when the king learns that the robbery victim was a Lombard (Italian moneylender), he refuses. Edward is particularly protective of foreign merchants and sees this as an opportunity to demonstrate his support for them. He waves Bull away dismissively.</p>

<p>Defeated and desperate, Bull rides slowly back toward London. As he passes the Savoy Palace near the Aldwych, he sees a group of aldermen riding to Parliament, including his bitter enemy <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a>. In that moment, Bull realizes there is one last chance: Barnikel has the king's ear and might be able to change Edward's mind. Setting aside his pride and hatred, Bull approaches Barnikel and begs him to intercede with the king.</p>

<p>Barnikel, recognizing both the humiliation this costs Bull and the opportunity to demonstrate his own power over his fallen rival, agrees. He petitions the king for Martin's pardon. King Edward, amused that a second person would beg for the life of this obscure apprentice, grants the request - though he pointedly tells Barnikel that he will expect future favors in return during the Parliament's proceedings.</p>

<p>Barnikel, Bull, and a royal clerk ride swiftly to Smithfield, where Martin already stands under an elm tree with a noose around his neck. They arrive just in time with the cry: "Royal pardon!"</p>

<h3 id='1295-marriage'>1295: Marriage</h3>

<p>Martin and Joan are married a few days later in the porch of St Mary Overy church in Southwark. The wedding is attended by the most unlikely group of witnesses: <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a> stands by Martin as groomsman, <a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a> gives the bride away, and <a href="characters/Isobel-Dogget-1270.html">Isobel</a> and <a href="characters/Margery-Dogget-1270.html">Margery Dogget</a> serve as bridesmaids.</p>

<p>It requires a long conversation with Bull to overcome Martin's horror at Joan's action in becoming a prostitute, even in name only. By the time of the wedding, Martin is fully satisfied of his wife's purity and virginity. However, neither Joan's family nor Martin's attend the ceremony - neither family has gotten over the shame of what occurred. The priest thinks he has never seen anything like it in his life.</p>

<p>The narrator notes with wry humor that Martin Fleming is "the only man in the church that day who had never slept with either of the Dogget sisters."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='martin-fleming'>Martin Fleming</h3>

<p>Joan's relationship with <a href="characters/Martin-Fleming-1277.html">Martin Fleming</a> is the driving force of her story. She sees past his physical weakness and social awkwardness to recognize a kind and devoted heart. Where other girls mock him, she treats him with genuine respect and affection. Their courtship is tender - he brings her small gifts and attends to her moods, while she gives him the confidence and sense of masculine strength he has never felt before.</p>

<p>Her willingness to sacrifice her reputation and endure public shame to save his life demonstrates the extraordinary depth of her love. The most heartbreaking moment of her story comes when Martin, learning what she has done, rejects her at the gallows because he cannot overcome his horror at her having become a prostitute, even temporarily and even to save his life. His rejection represents not ingratitude but rather his inability to reconcile his idealized image of Joan's purity with the reality of her actions.</p>

<p>That Bull must spend considerable time convincing Martin to accept Joan even after his pardon suggests the profound psychological impact of the ordeal on both young people. By the time of their wedding, Martin has come to understand and accept what Joan did, though the fact that neither family attends shows that the social consequences of her actions persist.</p>

<h3 id='the-dogget-sisters'>The Dogget Sisters</h3>

<p>Joan's relationship with <a href="characters/Isobel-Dogget-1270.html">Isobel</a> and <a href="characters/Margery-Dogget-1270.html">Margery Dogget</a> crosses a significant social boundary. The two prostitutes take pity on the desperate girl and devise the elaborate plan to save Martin. They promise to protect her virginity during her night at the brothel and successfully execute a complex deception to keep that promise when <a href="characters/Dionysius-Silversleeves-1266.html">Dionysius Silversleeves</a> demands her services.</p>

<p>The sisters' warmth and protectiveness toward Joan contrasts sharply with the harsh judgments of respectable society. They are willing to take risks and use their professional skills to help a girl they barely know. Their presence as bridesmaids at Joan's wedding - alongside the merchant who tried to purchase her virginity and the alderman who was his rival for her - creates one of the most socially transgressive and touching scenes in the chapter. The Dogget sisters represent the complexity of morality in medieval London, where those society deems sinful often demonstrate greater charity than the respectable.</p>

<h3 id='william-bull'>William Bull</h3>

<p>Joan's interaction with <a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a> transforms both their lives. When Bull arrives at the Dog's Head expecting to take her virginity, Joan desperately tells him the truth about her plan. His decision to believe her, protect her, and help her represents a moral choice that costs him money, pride, and eventually requires him to humble himself before his worst enemy.</p>

<p>Bull's promise - "I said I'd help her" - drives him to extraordinary efforts on her behalf. He rides to Westminster to beg the king for a pardon, and when that fails, he swallows his pride to approach <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a> for help. His giving Joan away at her wedding symbolizes his role as protector and sponsor. For Bull, a man recently defeated politically and suffering in his own marriage, helping Joan seems to restore some sense of purpose and moral worth. Joan's courage and devotion inspire him to rediscover his own better nature.</p>

<h3 id='her-family'>Her Family</h3>

<p>Joan's relationship with her father and two brothers undergoes a painful transformation. Her father is described as "a decent, solemn craftsman" who paints elaborate wooden saddles for the wealthy. He had hoped Joan would marry "a craftsman of the same kind" as themselves and was skeptical of Martin's poor prospects. Nevertheless, he agreed to let them wait two years in hopes that Martin's situation might improve.</p>

<p>When Joan becomes a registered prostitute, her family is devastated by the shame. At the gallows, when she tries to run after the departing tumbrel, it is her father and brothers who hold her back with "grave, stern faces," telling her "It's over." Their refusal to attend her wedding shows that the breach between them is profound and perhaps permanent. Joan's sacrifice thus costs her not only her reputation but her family relationships - a price that medieval society would have considered catastrophic for a young woman.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Joan's story takes place in 1295 during the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Edward I</a>, a period of significant change in London's governance and economy. The city is dominated by wealthy merchant families competing for political power, exemplified by the rivalry between Bull and Barnikel. Edward has recently expelled the Jewish population from England (1290), which has practical consequences for ordinary Londoners - the Jewish doctors who used to treat venereal diseases are gone, creating problems for the Dogget sisters and others.</p>

<p>The legal provision that Joan attempts to use - allowing a prostitute to claim a condemned man from the gallows - reflects medieval London's complex attitudes toward both prostitution and mercy. Prostitution is regulated but tolerated, with the brothels on Bankside operating under license from the Bishop of Winchester. The women are required to wear distinctive striped garments and are registered with the bishop's bailiff. They are both marginalized and semi-protected by this system.</p>

<p>Joan's status as an artisan's daughter places her in London's middle ranks - above the poor but far below the merchant class. Her father is skilled enough to work on elaborate saddles for nobles, but lacks the wealth to provide a significant dowry. The two-year waiting period her father imposes reflects the economic realities facing young people of this class: marriage required resources that apprentices and young craftsmen often lacked.</p>

<p>The strict curfew laws that trap Martin reflect Edward I's concern with maintaining order in London. The particular severity of Martin's punishment stems from his victim being a Lombard - Italian moneylenders who filled the economic role previously held by Jewish financiers. Edward's protection of these foreign merchants is both practical (he needs their financial services) and political (he wants to demonstrate his favor to the Pope and Italian allies).</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Joan embodies several significant themes in the novel. Most fundamentally, she represents the theme of sacrificial love - the willingness to endure shame, rejection, and the loss of everything one values to save another person. Her sacrifice is particularly poignant because it fails on its own terms (Martin rejects her) and only succeeds because her story moves others to action.</p>

<p>Her story also illustrates the vulnerability of women in medieval society. A fifteen-year-old girl has virtually no power to save her condemned fiancé through official channels. The only path available to her requires destroying her own reputation and placing herself in a sexually vulnerable position. The fact that even her devoted labor and sacrifice are not enough - that she requires the intervention of powerful men like Bull and Barnikel - underscores the limited agency of women in this world.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Joan demonstrates that women in this society possess forms of power that operate outside official structures. The Dogget sisters' sexual knowledge and professional skills enable them to protect Joan's virginity through deception. Joan's very willingness to become a prostitute, paradoxically, is what moves Bull to help her - her courage shames him into acting more courageously himself.</p>

<p>The novel uses Joan's story to explore the gap between social status and moral worth. The "respectable" craftsman families (Joan's and Martin's) abandon the young couple in their moment of crisis, while prostitutes (the Dogget sisters) risk themselves to help, and a merchant with a troubled marriage (Bull) demonstrates real nobility. The wedding scene, with its unlikely mixture of prostitutes, rival merchants, and an alderman, suggests that true community and genuine morality exist outside the rigid boundaries of social hierarchy.</p>

<p>Joan's story also raises questions about purity and honor. Martin's initial rejection of her occurs precisely because he believes her pure and cannot accept her transformation into a prostitute, even to save him. The fact that she technically retained her virginity through the Dogget sisters' trick is irrelevant to the social consequences she faces - in medieval London's eyes, she is permanently marked by having registered as a prostitute. The novel suggests that rigid concepts of female purity and honor can be both precious (driving Joan's own reluctance) and destructive (causing Martin to reject her and her family to abandon her).</p>

<p>Finally, Joan represents the human cost of London's political and economic systems. Her story intersects with larger forces - Edward I's protection of foreign merchants, the rivalry between patrician families and new aldermen, the regulation of Bankside prostitution - but these systems care nothing for her individual suffering. Only when her plight moves individuals to act outside their usual roles (Bull humbling himself to Barnikel, Barnikel helping his enemy's cause) does the system bend enough to save Martin. Her story thus illustrates both the harshness of medieval justice and the possibility of mercy arising from human compassion rather than legal structures.</p>
