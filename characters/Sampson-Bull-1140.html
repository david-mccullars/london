<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Sampson Bull is a wealthy London mercer and alderman during the late 12th century whose life embodies the tension between personal ambition and family relationships. A blunt, pragmatic businessman who openly declares he does not believe in God, Sampson achieves his lifelong dream of reclaiming his family's ancestral estate of Bocton in Kent, lost at the Norman Conquest. His greatest triumph - securing London's status as a commune with a mayor - is poisoned by the simultaneous loss of his beloved son David. A man of fierce temper but also of his word, Sampson represents the rising merchant class of London that would challenge royal authority and reshape English governance.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Sampson Bull is described as having a large, broad-faced, bulky frame with a head thrust forward that matches his family name. He has a strong jowl typically carrying two days' growth of fair beard, fair hair, ruddy complexion, and bright blue eyes. His physical presence is imposing and he habitually dresses in red - wearing a long red gown, red hose, red tunic with gold cuffs, painted leather belt, and a large red beret. His appearance, combined with his forward-thrusting head, gives him the look of an indignant cockerel or charging bull.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Sampson Bull is characterized above all by his blunt pragmatism and famous temper. Unlike his pious younger brother Michael, Sampson openly declares he does not believe in God and views religious institutions cynically as human creations designed for wealth and power. His worldview is shaped by a Saxon merchant's sense of fairness - he sees issues in stark black and white, right and wrong. When cheated by the king's fishing kiddles that damage his ship, he makes a solemn vow to stop them, a promise he keeps for over forty years.</p>

<p>Despite his irreligion and coarseness, Sampson is fundamentally a man of his word. He never lies, though he admits he may "exaggerate a little." His marriage vows, business agreements, and even his angry promise to his brother about leaving Bocton to St Bartholomew's Hospital are binding to him. This integrity exists alongside a ruthless pragmatism - he has no qualms about profiting from a crusader's bankruptcy or making deals with traitors if it serves London's interests.</p>

<p>His temper is legendary. The veins stand out on his forehead when angered, his face reddens dramatically, and he is capable of striking even his pregnant wife in his grief-fueled rage. Yet beneath this explosive exterior lies genuine affection for his family, particularly his son David, and a capacity for cleverness in both business and intimate relationships.</p>

<p>Sampson embodies the merchant class's emerging political consciousness. He refers to London's burghers as "barons" without irony and believes passionately in London's ancient customs and rights. His statement "If the king won't play by the rules, if he turns his back on custom, we won't stand for it" captures his fundamental political philosophy.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1170-alderman-and-family-patriarch'>1170: Alderman and Family Patriarch</h3>

<p>At age thirty, Sampson becomes alderman of his ward following his father's death two years earlier. As a rich mercer, he represents the pinnacle of London's merchant class. His family has adopted the name Bull, derived from their business sign, abandoning the Norman system of patronymics that became confusing across generations.</p>

<p>Sampson's greatest moment comes when Abraham, a Jewish moneylender, offers him the ancestral estate of Bocton in Kent. Lost by his ancestor Leofric at the Norman Conquest, the estate had been mortgaged by Jean de St Malo to finance his crusade. When the crusade failed and St Malo went bankrupt, Abraham repossessed it. As Jewish law prohibited land ownership, Abraham immediately seeks out the Bull family. Sampson's ship, carrying a third of his fortune in wool bound for Flanders, will provide the purchase price upon its return.</p>

<p>However, his joyous day turns bitter when his ship is fouled by kiddles - fishing nets and weirs cluttering the Thames. The royal Constable of the Tower cynically leases fishing rights for maximum profit, creating obstacles that damage shipping. Standing alone on the wharf, staring toward the Tower, Sampson makes a solemn vow: "I'll stop them one day."</p>

<h3 id='1170-family-tensions-and-brother-michael'>1170: Family Tensions and Brother Michael</h3>

<p>Sampson's relationship with his younger brother Michael is complex and strained. When Michael leaves prestigious Westminster Abbey to work at the humble Hospital of St Bartholomew, Sampson is contemptuous, viewing the donations to Westminster as "completely wasted." Their mother constantly takes Michael's side, which has irritated Sampson since childhood.</p>

<p>The breaking point comes when Sister Mabel Barnikel confronts Sampson at the hospital, calling him wicked and predicting he will "go to hell with the Jews." Sampson explodes in rage, damning the hospital, crusaders, and hypocritical priests. In fury, he declares: "If ever I need a religion, then by God I'll be a Jew" - echoing King William Rufus's famous threat.</p>

<p>His cruelest attack targets Michael's monastic vows: "You make no money because you took a vow of poverty. You never have a woman because you took a vow of chastity. You never even think for yourself because you took a vow of obedience. What for? Who knows?" Then, inspired, he issues an astonishing challenge: "Send for me, or my successors, on your deathbed. Swear before God and a priest that you have never broken your vows from this day to your ending, and by God I'll give Bocton to Bartholomew's."</p>

<p>Despite this conflict, Sampson successfully purchases Bocton from Abraham, crowning his achievement.</p>

<h3 id='1189-1190-marriage-to-ida'>1189-1190: Marriage to Ida</h3>

<p>When King Richard I needs funds for the Third Crusade, he sells wardships and widows. Through <a href="characters/Pentecost-Silversleeves-1145.html">Pentecost Silversleeves</a>, Sampson purchases the right to marry Ida, impoverished widow of a knight. This disparagement marriage - forcing a woman of the knightly class to marry a merchant - humiliates Ida, who finds it as shameful as if she liked him.</p>

<p>Sampson handles the marriage cleverly. Understanding Ida's repugnance, he sees it as a challenge and takes his time in the bedchamber. Within three nights, despite herself, Ida cries out with pleasure. Through Bocton, which he takes her to visit, Sampson edges his family into the Norman upper class that had supplanted them at the Conquest. He explains to David: "One day she can help us find a noble wife for you too."</p>

<p>The marriage brings complications. Ida maintains her class consciousness, and when Sampson speaks treason against King Richard over excessive taxation, she reproves him. But Sampson coolly explains the political reality: "The king's a fool. The barons of London are not to be trifled with." He warns that if Richard won't play by the rules and turns his back on custom, London won't stand for it.</p>

<p>When Brother Michael suggests David should go on crusade at King Richard's coronation, Sampson briefly shows no anger, merely asking mildly, "Are you so anxious, Brother, that this boy should die?" He knows many crusaders don't return.</p>

<h3 id='1189-the-jewish-riot'>1189: The Jewish Riot</h3>

<p>During the coronation riot against London's Jews, Sampson reveals his limits. When Brother Michael brings Abraham, the Jewish moneylender from whom he purchased Bocton, seeking shelter, Sampson refuses: "Sorry. I don't want my house burned down." Even Michael's protest that "You got Bocton from him. He could be killed otherwise" doesn't sway him: "Too risky. Sorry."</p>

<p>This moment shows Sampson's transactional worldview - business is business, but personal risk is another matter. Ironically, it is <a href="characters/Pentecost-Silversleeves-1145.html">Pentecost Silversleeves</a> who saves Abraham, taking him to the Tower where the king's Jewish "chattels" are protected.</p>

<h3 id='1190-1191-the-political-crisis'>1190-1191: The Political Crisis</h3>

<p>Relations between Sampson and Michael improve over the years, partly due to their mother's influence. Before she dies around 1190, she entrusts Michael with a considerable sum "for religious purposes," believing her son Sampson is "still a lost soul." Surprisingly, Sampson laughs off the bequest rather than protesting. When his first wife dies around 1188, Michael visits daily, prompting Sampson to remark apologetically, "I must say, Brother, you've behaved uncommonly well."</p>

<p>During the political crisis of 1191, when Richard is on crusade and his brother John schemes to seize power, Sampson becomes central to London's machinations. The city, led by its aldermen, sees an opportunity. Chancellor Longchamp, Richard's representative, is unpopular and vulnerable. Prince John offers London something it has long desired: commune status with an elected mayor.</p>

<p>Sampson and six other aldermen meet secretly at the house near the London Stone to plan their strategy. They need a stooge to manipulate, and Sampson declares: "I know exactly the man. Leave it to me" - identifying Silversleeves. For months, Sampson cultivates friendship with the Exchequer clerk, learning intelligence about Longchamp's plans while feeding him misinformation. Sampson's performance is "masterly," though as he admits, "I may have exaggerated a little."</p>

<h3 id='october-1191-triumph-and-tragedy'>October 1191: Triumph and Tragedy</h3>

<p>On October 6, Sampson reveals his deal to Ida and David. The next day, London will open its gates to Prince John, depose Longchamp, and recognize John as Richard's heir. In return, Prince John grants London commune status. Sampson beams: "London is free."</p>

<p>Ida erupts in fury, calling it a cynical betrayal: "So that you merchants can strut and call yourselves barons and pretend your mayor's a king? For that you have sold England to that devil John? You traitor!" Sampson shrugs and turns around - failing to see young David staring at him through tears, not only with shock but, for the first time in his life, with hatred, before rushing out of the house.</p>

<p>That night, David encounters Pentecost Silversleeves, who has just killed one of Prince John's knights. When David tells Silversleeves about the aldermen's betrayal, the clerk realizes the boy is a dangerous witness to both the killing and the betrayal. Silversleeves murders David, staging it to look like mutual combat with the knight.</p>

<p>On October 7, 1191, at the momentous ceremony where London is declared a commune with a mayor, "a red-faced Alderman Sampson Bull stood somewhat apart from his fellows, who tried not to look at his large body shaking almost continuously with silent tears."</p>

<p>When the tragedy becomes known and Sampson returns home with David's body, he blames Ida in his grief: "It was you who turned him against me and filled his head with nonsense. Now see what you have done. Get out of my house, for ever." When she refuses, he strikes her repeatedly, breaking two of her teeth, only stopping when she reveals she is pregnant.</p>

<p>Strangely, in his pain, it is to Brother Michael that Sampson turns for comfort.</p>

<h3 id='1215-final-achievement'>1215: Final Achievement</h3>

<p>Twenty-four years after David's death, the great charter of Magna Carta includes clause thirty-three, which Sampson had fought for since 1170: "Henceforth all kiddles shall be completely removed from the Thames and the Medway and throughout all England, except on the sea coast." After over forty years of waiting, Alderman Sampson Bull has triumphed over the king.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='brother-michael-bull'>Brother Michael Bull</h3>

<p>The relationship between the brothers is marked by fundamental opposition yet underlying affection. Sampson views Michael's monasticism with contempt, seeing his vows as life-denying foolishness. His cruel challenge about keeping vows reflects genuine doubt about whether such purity is possible. Yet when Michael tends to Sampson and David during his first wife's death, Sampson acknowledges his brother's goodness. In Sampson's greatest grief after David's death, he seeks comfort from Michael rather than from anyone else, suggesting a deeper bond than their arguments indicate.</p>

<h3 id='david-bull'>David Bull</h3>

<p>Sampson's relationship with his son is central to his life. He loves David deeply and dreams of the family's rise into nobility through the boy. His relatively mild response to David's crusading desires shows paternal understanding - he recognizes it as youthful enthusiasm that will pass. When David grows ill after the monastery incident, Sampson takes him to Bocton, and they experience unprecedented contentment together. David's death on the very day of Sampson's greatest political triumph transforms his victory into ashes. His violent grief and his body "shaking almost continuously with silent tears" during the commune ceremony reveal the depth of his loss.</p>

<h3 id='ida-bull'>Ida Bull</h3>

<p>The marriage begins as a purely transactional arrangement but develops complexity. Sampson approaches the marriage as a challenge and shows cleverness in winning her physically. He takes pride in her nobility and sees her as key to the family's social advancement. Their relationship reaches its warmest during the summer at Bocton, when they seem genuinely companionable. However, Ida's class consciousness and his merchant pragmatism create an unbridgeable gap. Her accusation of treason over the commune deal and his violent reaction to David's death permanently damage their relationship, though she bears him additional children.</p>

<h3 id='pentecost-silversleeves'>Pentecost Silversleeves</h3>

<p>Sampson views Silversleeves with mercantile calculation. He cultivates the clerk as a useful source of intelligence and as a "stooge" to manipulate during the commune negotiations. Despite the manipulation, Sampson keeps his word about helping Silversleeves with Prince John's council after the clerk abandons Longchamp. When Silversleeves asks if Sampson has seen David on the night of his death, Sampson has no idea he is speaking to his son's murderer.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Sampson Bull's life spans a crucial period in London's constitutional development. The tension between royal authority and urban independence that defines his career reflects the broader struggle that would culminate in Magna Carta. The system of "the farm" - London's annual tax payment - is the flashpoint. When strong kings like William I or Henry II rule, they raise the farm and appoint sheriffs; when kings are weak or absent, London negotiates better terms.</p>

<p>Richard I's crusade and absence create a power vacuum. His need for money leads to the sale of offices, wardships, and widows - the system through which Sampson acquires Ida. The struggle between Chancellor Longchamp and Prince John offers London its opportunity. The aldermen's secret meeting and their deal with John, though portrayed as treasonous by Ida's knightly class, represents the merchant class's sophisticated understanding of power politics.</p>

<p>The concept of a commune - self-governing urban corporation with an elected mayor - comes from continental Europe, particularly France and Italy. For London's merchants, it represents recognition as a collective feudal entity, "barons" in their own right. When Sampson declares "London is free," he means free from arbitrary royal interference in its ancient customs. This merchant class consciousness would fundamentally reshape English governance.</p>

<p>The kiddles issue illustrates the intersection of royal privilege, urban commerce, and institutional corruption. The king's fishing rights, cynically exploited by the Constable of the Tower, damage shipping but generate revenue. Sampson's forty-year fight to eliminate them, finally achieved in Magna Carta's clause thirty-three, shows both his tenacity and the long timeline of constitutional reform.</p>

<p>The Jewish community's position also frames Sampson's era. Jews serve as royal financiers and moneylenders, technically "chattels of the king." The 1189 riot, England's first major anti-Jewish violence, begins the erosion of their position. Sampson's willingness to profit from Abraham's forced sale of Bocton, while refusing him shelter during the riot, reflects the complex relationship between Christians and Jews in medieval commerce.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Sampson Bull embodies several of the novel's central themes. Most fundamentally, he represents the rising merchant class's challenge to feudal hierarchy. His pride in Bocton and desire to marry David into nobility show he still values the old order even as he undermines it. The disparagement marriage that humiliates Ida reveals both his upward mobility and the class system's brittleness.</p>

<p>His relationship with his brother Michael explores the tension between worldly pragmatism and religious idealism. Sampson's atheism is not mere cynicism but reflects a brutal honesty about institutional Christianity. Yet his challenge about Michael keeping his vows suggests he suspects such purity might be impossible - or perhaps secretly admires it.</p>

<p>The tragedy of David's death on the day of Sampson's greatest triumph illustrates the novel's pattern of personal loss accompanying historical achievement. Like London itself, Sampson gains freedom and power but at terrible cost. His tears during the commune ceremony transform what should be celebration into mourning, suggesting that even legitimate political victories may be purchased with innocent blood.</p>

<p>Sampson's forty-year fight against the kiddles demonstrates how personal grievances can drive constitutional reform. His vow on the wharf in 1170, kept until its achievement in Magna Carta around 1215, shows how individual determination can reshape institutions. The kiddles are not merely fishing nets but symbols of arbitrary royal power that ignores London's customs and commercial needs.</p>

<p>His blunt statement "I don't believe in God" places him in a skeptical tradition that includes William Rufus, yet unlike Rufus's aristocratic contempt, Sampson's skepticism arises from merchant practicality. He sees churches as wealthy institutions and religious claims as human constructions, a view that anticipates later secular perspectives while remaining shocking in his era.</p>

<p>Finally, Sampson represents the complex morality of historical progress. He achieves genuine goods - London's commune, the elimination of kiddles, his family's restoration to Bocton - through morally questionable means: profiting from crusaders' bankruptcies, betraying Richard for John, striking his pregnant wife. He is neither hero nor villain but a man whose Saxon directness and merchant pragmatism make him an effective agent of change, even as his personal life ends in tragedy. His tears at the commune ceremony, his grief-stricken violence, and his final turn to his brother Michael for comfort reveal a man who has won everything he sought but lost what mattered most.</p>
