<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Jane Fleming is a young woman who begins as a fifteen-year-old theatre worker in Elizabethan London, infatuated with aspiring playwright <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a>. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she is kidnapped by the pirate <a href="characters/Orlando-Black-Barnikel-1562.html">Orlando Black Barnikel</a> and spends fifteen years as his companion across the world's oceans. After being left in Virginia, she becomes a successful tobacco planter as the Widow Wheeler, eventually returning to London where she pursues justice against <a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Julius Ducket</a> for stolen treasure. Her story spans over eighty years, from the height of Elizabethan theatre to the Great Plague of 1665, and embodies themes of resilience, adaptation, and the determination to reclaim what was rightfully hers.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Red hair and pale, freckled skin are mentioned in her youth. No other physical description is provided beyond these distinctive features, which Orlando Barnikel notes with interest when they first meet.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Jane is characterized by remarkable resilience and pragmatism in the face of extraordinary circumstances. In her youth, she is earnest and somewhat naive, harboring romantic feelings for Edmund Meredith despite his calculated interest in her modest legacy. She works diligently in her family's theatre business and genuinely loves the life of travelling players.</p>

<p>When kidnapped by Black Barnikel, she demonstrates a capacity for acceptance and adaptation that allows her to survive. She studies her captor carefully, recognizes his tenderness beneath his fearsome exterior, and eventually comes to love him in her own way—particularly as she understands his rage at being an outcast despite his accomplishments. She shows maternal devotion by refusing to abandon her mixed-race children, even when it means forgoing any chance of returning to London.</p>

<p>In Virginia, Jane proves herself a capable businesswoman, running a profitable tobacco plantation with "sweated labour" and earning a reputation for being "fair but ruthless." She is practical and forward-thinking, planning her financial future carefully.</p>

<p>Upon returning to London, she becomes tenacious in pursuing her claim to Black Barnikel's treasure from Julius Ducket. She is willing to use any means available—lawyers, friends in the Puritan network, even manipulating situations to search his house. She maintains her pragmatism through a discreet affair with <a href="characters/John-Dogget-1570.html">John Dogget</a>, bringing "life and warmth" to both of them in their old age.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1597-1599-theatre-life-in-shoreditch'>1597-1599: Theatre Life in Shoreditch</h3>

<p>At age fifteen, Jane Fleming works as an assistant in the tiring house (costume room) for the Chamberlain's Men, alongside her father Gabriel (the keeper) and mother Nan. Her little brother Henry has just started as a boy-actor. The family lives in a narrow house just behind the Theatre, constantly filled with costumes and the cheerful chaos of theatrical life.</p>

<p>Jane loves the theatrical world—the summer tours traveling from town to town, the freedom of the road, the excitement of performances. She has romantic feelings for Edmund Meredith, an aspiring playwright who shows interest in her partly because of a small legacy she is to receive from an uncle. She admires Edmund's wit and literary ambitions, following the progress of his play with genuine enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At a cockfight in 1597, Jane witnesses Edmund's witty but contemptuous exchange with Black Barnikel, a dark-skinned pirate of mixed race. The encounter unsettles her—she finds the stranger frightening but cannot help stealing glances at him.</p>

<h3 id='1599-kidnapping-and-the-globe'>1599: Kidnapping and the Globe</h3>

<p>When the Theatre's lease expires, the Chamberlain's Men plan to move operations and build a new theatre—eventually the Globe. During this transitional period, Jane spends time with both Edmund and John Dogget, a young waterman. Edmund's play is finally performed at the Globe, but it is a disaster. The play portrays a villain clearly based on Black Barnikel, and when the real Black Barnikel attends the performance sitting in the Lords' Room, the audience begins throwing food at him while laughing at the play's crude mockery.</p>

<p>The night after the disastrous performance, Jane walks Edmund home and comforts him with a long kiss. The following evening, Black Barnikel and his crew kidnap Edmund, but it is actually Jane whom Barnikel wants—intending to punish Edmund by stealing his woman.</p>

<p>Jane is carried onto Barnikel's ship. As they sail down the Thames estuary and out to sea, she has "no illusions about what was to come" but feels "a strange sense of excitement" as they enter the open waters. She thinks of her parents, Dogget, and Meredith "with affection, and then, deliberately, cast their images into the wind."</p>

<h3 id='1599-c1620-life-with-black-barnikel'>1599-c.1620: Life with Black Barnikel</h3>

<p>Jane becomes Black Barnikel's woman for fifteen years, traveling the world's oceans with him. She has no choice initially but discovers he is "surprisingly tender" and knows "how to bring her to physical ecstasy."</p>

<p>During their first voyage, she becomes pregnant. Black Barnikel leaves her in an African port to have the child, then returns months later "delighted to find he had a son" and showers her with gifts. Over the years, they have three more children together—five voyages, a dozen ports, three more children surviving. Her life is spent in "strange, exotic places, from the Caribbean to the Levant."</p>

<p>Does she consider escape? Black Barnikel is "too cunning to give her the chance" and never goes near London. She also realizes she cannot abandon her children, and wonders what life would be like for them in London with their dark skin. It is through thinking about her children's situation that she comes to understand "Orlando Barnikel's secret rage" at being forever an outcast, and "it was at such times, far more even than those of physical passion, that she recognized that, in a way, she loved him."</p>

<p>After the third surviving child, she loses two more babies and ceases to conceive. When her younger boy is twelve and makes his first voyage with his father, Orlando announces they are sailing to Virginia. Upon arrival at Jamestown, he puts a bag of money in her hand and declares: "It is time for you to leave me now." She is almost thirty—young enough to marry and start a family in a colony desperate for wives. She never sees or hears of Orlando Barnikel again.</p>

<h3 id='c1620-c1633-widow-wheeler-in-virginia'>c.1620-c.1633: Widow Wheeler in Virginia</h3>

<p>Six months after arriving in Virginia, Jane marries Wheeler, a planter. He soon falls sick, and they have no children together. After his death, she inherits his farm and becomes the Widow Wheeler, running a profitable tobacco plantation on Wheeler's Hill.</p>

<p>She employs two slaves and several indentured English laborers (some poor, some in debt, a few petty criminals working off ten years). She has a reputation for being "fair but ruthless" and for being frugal—while other successful planters import luxury goods from England, "the Widow Wheeler bought almost nothing."</p>

<p>Her neighbors know little about her and would be shocked to learn she had lived with Black Barnikel the pirate for fifteen years. She keeps her past to herself, standing each evening on the low ridge called Wheeler's Hill, gazing eastward—sometimes toward the distant glimpse of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>News from an indentured laborer from Southwark informs her that her parents have died and her brother has gone to the West Country. This gives her "a curious sense of freedom"—she realizes "it made no difference to anyone what she did now. She would face no awkward questions." Knowing the tobacco plantation will be exhausted in three years, she begins saving money and planning to do "something else."</p>

<h3 id='c1633-1649-return-to-london'>c.1633-1649: Return to London</h3>

<p>Jane returns to England and settles in Petty France, a modest area near Westminster. She carries with her a document proving that Orlando Barnikel left her his treasure chest, which was deposited with Alderman Ducket years before.</p>

<p>Two days after the execution of Charles I in January 1649, Jane presents herself to <a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Julius Ducket</a>, showing him Black Barnikel's document. The paper clearly describes the treasure chest that once resided in the Ducket cellar. Julius, horrified at losing what he considers his family's money and unwilling to give anything to associates of the hated Puritans, denies all knowledge. "I fear, Mistress Wheeler, that this document may be a forgery," he claims.</p>

<p>Jane responds calmly but directly: "You're lying."</p>

<p>That night, Julius destroys the old chest, burning it and burying the metal remains, hoping to end the matter. But Jane is relentless. She returns a week later, revealing that <a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1606.html">Gideon Carpenter</a> has searched Bocton and found nothing. She challenges Julius again and again, has a lawyer write to him, demands to search his house. Years pass, but she refuses to give up.</p>

<h3 id='1650s-1665-friendship-affair-and-plotting'>1650s-1665: Friendship, Affair, and Plotting</h3>

<p>Jane becomes close friends with <a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha Carpenter</a>, the godly Puritan wife of John Dogget. The two women's friendship is genuine, bonded by Martha's network within the Puritan community.</p>

<p>Jane also conducts a discreet affair with John Dogget that lasts for years. The relationship began while Martha was in Massachusetts with the Mayflower settlers. After Martha's return around 1652, Martha tells Dogget they are "too old" for marital relations and "God wouldn't approve." Jane and Dogget meet on Sunday afternoons when Martha attends services at St Lawrence Silversleeves. Jane brings John "life and warmth" in his old age, and he does the same for her.</p>

<p>Jane sometimes wonders if Martha knows and chooses to ignore the affair, but concludes that Martha's earnest nature means she genuinely doesn't suspect—she's simply "not curious enough even to discover."</p>

<p>In December 1652, Jane collaborates with Martha and Gideon to search Julius Ducket's house. When Jane sees Julius's wife buying a large joint of beef at market, she realizes they're planning an illegal Christmas dinner. She proposes the idea to Martha, who organizes a raid with Gideon and Roundhead soldiers, ostensibly to arrest them for the crime of celebrating Christmas and search for "popish images," but actually to look for the treasure chest.</p>

<p>The search finds nothing. Julius, furious at the violation of his home and seeing both Martha and Jane waiting by the gate, realizes the true motive. In rage, he reveals Jane's affair to Martha: "What a good friend you are, Mistress Martha. You help your friend search for her treasure as well as letting her sleep with your husband."</p>

<h3 id='1665-death-and-final-curse'>1665: Death and Final Curse</h3>

<p>During the Great Plague of 1665, Jane falls ill at her house in Petty France. At over eighty years old, she develops the bubonic plague with its characteristic symptoms—fever, pain in her limbs, swollen lymph glands (buboes) in her neck, armpits, and between her legs.</p>

<p>A watchman brings Dr. <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a> (Edmund's grandson) to attend her. Jane, lucid in her final hours despite her suffering, asks him to write her will. She leaves her diminished fortune equally to all surviving children of John Dogget deceased, except for Martha's child.</p>

<p>Then comes her final paragraph: "Finally, with this my last testament, and with my dying breath, to Sir Julius Ducket, thief and liar, who has stolen my rightful fortune and caused my ruin, I bequeath my curse. May God, who is just, send him to hellfire for his sins, and may his family be cursed hereafter and his inheritance stolen as mine has been. Amen."</p>

<p>When Richard Meredith asks if she's sure she wants to say that, she insists: "I am." She signs with difficulty, and both Meredith and the nurse witness the will. Jane dies shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Meredith decides not to tell Julius he has been cursed, but Julius later learns of it when Jane's will becomes known. The curse haunts Julius for the rest of his life, and events in subsequent chapters suggest the Ducket family believes the curse has power.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='edmund-meredithedmund-meredith-1575html'><a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Jane's youthful infatuation with Edmund is genuine but one-sided. She admires his wit and literary ambitions, thinking "How fine, how clever he was" as she watches him spar verbally with Black Barnikel. Edmund, by contrast, views Jane pragmatically: she's young enough "to look up to and be moulded by a man like himself," pretty but not so beautiful as to attract rival suitors, involved in the theatre world, and set to receive "enough to keep a family" from her uncle's legacy. He considers that "in time, perhaps, he would marry young Jane Fleming."</p>

<p>When Edmund's play fails catastrophically, Jane walks him home and gives him a long kiss, offering comfort at his lowest moment. This act of kindness is remembered afterward—the narrator notes: "Afterwards, she would be glad that she did it." The next night, when Jane is kidnapped, Edmund is briefly concerned, wondering "what of poor Jane Fleming?" but he quickly moves on with his life.</p>

<h3 id='orlando-black-barnikelorlando-black-barnikel-1562html'><a href="characters/Orlando-Black-Barnikel-1562.html">Orlando Black Barnikel</a></h3>

<p>The relationship with Black Barnikel is complex and evolves dramatically over fifteen years. It begins as kidnapping and captivity—Jane has "no choice" and knows "he could probably kill her." But she studies him carefully and finds him "surprisingly tender." Whether she wishes it or not, "he knew how to bring her to physical ecstasy."</p>

<p>Over time, genuine feelings develop. She has four children with him (three surviving), and though she could not choose to stay initially, she eventually chooses not to abandon them even when it means never returning to London. The deepest connection comes through understanding his pain: when she considers what life would be like for her mixed-race children in London, "she guessed at Orlando Barnikel's secret rage" at being forever an outcast despite his accomplishments. "It was at such times, far more even than those of physical passion, that she recognized that, in a way, she loved him."</p>

<p>Black Barnikel, for his part, initially kidnaps Jane to punish Edmund Meredith and solve his own problem of finding a woman. But he shows her tenderness, returns to her with gifts, delights in their children, and ultimately makes the difficult decision to leave her in Virginia with money when he recognizes she needs a different life than the one he can provide. He never contacts her again after their parting.</p>

<h3 id='john-doggetjohn-dogget-1570html'><a href="characters/John-Dogget-1570.html">John Dogget</a></h3>

<p>John Dogget was friendly with Jane in their youth, and when she disappears in 1599, he is "deeply upset." Twenty years after her disappearance, having married twice (once happily but his wife died, then to Martha), Dogget is reunited with Jane when she returns to London.</p>

<p>Their affair begins during Martha's absence in Massachusetts and continues after her return, when Martha declares they are too old for marital relations. They meet on Sunday afternoons while Martha attends church services. The relationship is affectionate and mutually sustaining—Jane brings John "life and warmth" and receives the same in return. She views their connection as "as much as anything, an act of friendship for a lonely man."</p>

<p>Jane sometimes wonders if Martha knows and chooses to ignore it, noting that Martha "clearly has no desire for him herself" and "seems glad enough to get him off her hands." The affair is exposed by Julius Ducket in 1652, devastating Martha but apparently not ending the relationship between Jane and John.</p>

<h3 id='martha-carpentermartha-carpenter-1584html'><a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha Carpenter</a></h3>

<p>Jane and Martha develop a genuine friendship despite their very different personalities and the secret affair Jane conducts with Martha's husband. Jane is pragmatic and worldly; Martha is earnest and godly. Yet they work together effectively, with Jane able to propose schemes that Martha's Puritan network can help execute.</p>

<p>In 1652, Jane proposes the plot to raid Julius Ducket's house under the pretext of catching him celebrating Christmas. "Martha was receptive. 'You are right,' she declared. 'Something should be done. I shall speak to Gideon.'" The friendship seems built on shared causes and Martha's genuine desire to help her friend seek justice.</p>

<p>When Julius reveals Jane's affair with John, Martha is "astonished" and devastated. The text does not reveal whether their friendship survives this revelation, though both women continue to live in London.</p>

<h3 id='julius-ducketjulius-ducket-1603html'><a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Julius Ducket</a></h3>

<p>Jane's relationship with Julius is entirely adversarial. He holds what she believes is rightfully hers—the treasure Black Barnikel left in his father's keeping. Julius views Jane as an associate of the hated Puritans and the cursed Dogget and Carpenter families, undeserving of money that might be needed for the Royalist cause.</p>

<p>Their conflict spans nearly two decades. Jane is persistent and resourceful, using every tool available to her—legal challenges, searches, her Puritan connections. Julius is defensive and ultimately dishonest, destroying evidence and lying to her face. His refusal to acknowledge her claim becomes, in her mind, the cause of her ruin.</p>

<p>The relationship reaches its bitter culmination when Jane, on her deathbed, formally curses Julius and his family. Julius, though he initially doesn't know about the curse, is eventually haunted by it. In later chapters, the Ducket family believes the curse has real power over their fate.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Jane Fleming's life spans one of the most transformative periods in English history, from the final years of Elizabeth I's reign through the English Civil War, the Commonwealth, and into the Restoration. Her story touches on several major historical developments:</p>

<p><strong>Elizabethan Theatre</strong>: Jane comes of age during the golden era of English drama, working for the Chamberlain's Men—the very company that included William Shakespeare. Her kidnapping occurs in 1599, the year the Globe Theatre opened. Her family's work preserving and transporting costumes was essential to the theatrical productions that were creating the English literary renaissance.</p>

<p><strong>Colonial Virginia</strong>: Jane experiences firsthand the early decades of English colonization in America. She arrives around 1620, just as the colony is finding stability through tobacco cultivation. Her success as a planter reflects the opportunities available to settlers—particularly widows—in a society desperate for population and labor. The mention of her two slaves alongside indentured English servants reflects the transitional period when slavery was beginning but had not yet become the dominant labor system it would become.</p>

<p><strong>The English Civil War and Commonwealth</strong>: Jane returns to London at the height of Puritan power, just after Charles I's execution in 1649. Her friendship with Martha and use of the Puritan network demonstrates the power these godly communities wielded during the Commonwealth period. The raid on Julius Ducket's house for celebrating Christmas illustrates the strict moral enforcement that characterized Cromwell's rule.</p>

<p><strong>The Great Plague</strong>: Jane's death during the plague of 1665 places her at another pivotal moment. She is one of an estimated 65,000 to 100,000 Londoners who died in this catastrophe. The detailed description of her bubonic plague symptoms and Dr. Richard Meredith's inability to understand or treat the disease reflects the medical helplessness of the era.</p>

<p>Throughout her long life, Jane embodies the adaptability required to survive through these tumultuous times—shifting from Elizabethan theatre culture to life at sea, from colonial planter to Puritan-adjacent widow in Commonwealth London.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p><strong>Resilience and Adaptation</strong>: Jane's life is defined by her ability to adapt to radically different circumstances. Kidnapped at fifteen, she makes a life with her captor. Left in Virginia, she becomes a successful planter. Returning to London decades later, she navigates an entirely transformed society. Her resilience is not passive acceptance but active engagement with her changing circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Justice and Revenge</strong>: The driving force of Jane's later years is the pursuit of what she believes is rightfully hers. Her decades-long campaign against Julius Ducket demonstrates both admirable tenacity and the consuming nature of grievance. Her deathbed curse is the culmination of this quest—when earthly justice fails, she invokes divine retribution. The novel suggests her curse has real power, making her a figure who transcends death to affect the Ducket family's future.</p>

<p><strong>Outsider Status</strong>: Jane's life repeatedly places her outside conventional society. As Black Barnikel's woman, she lives beyond the bounds of English respectability. As the mother of mixed-race children she cannot bring home, she understands the pain of permanent exile. Even upon returning to London, she lives in a society (Commonwealth Puritanism) that is not naturally hers, using its networks instrumentally. Her understanding of Black Barnikel's "secret rage" at being an outcast reflects her own experience of marginality.</p>

<p><strong>Female Agency in Constrained Circumstances</strong>: While Jane's life is shaped by male actions (Edmund's courtship, Barnikel's kidnapping, Julius's theft), she exercises agency within these constraints. She chooses not to abandon her children. She builds a successful business in Virginia. She conducts the relationship with John Dogget on her own terms. She pursues her claim against Julius with remarkable tenacity. Jane demonstrates how women in this era could carve out spaces for self-determination even within patriarchal structures.</p>

<p><strong>The Theatre as Catalyst</strong>: The theatrical world is where Jane's story begins and what leads to her kidnapping. The play that mocks Black Barnikel sets in motion the events that will define her entire life. Edmund Meredith's failed play—meant to immortalize him as a playwright—instead becomes the catalyst for Jane Fleming's remarkable journey across the world and through the decades.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences Across Generations</strong>: Jane's deathbed curse embodies the novel's broader theme that actions in one generation ripple across time. The treasure that Alderman Ducket kept for Black Barnikel, the grudge Julius harbors against "cursed" families, Jane's curse itself—all represent how the past shapes the future. Her grandson Richard Meredith unwittingly witnesses her final act, never knowing his connection to her early love.</p>
