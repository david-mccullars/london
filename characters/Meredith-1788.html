<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Meredith is a private banker in the City of London who runs Meredith's Bank, a small commercial banking house specializing in trade financing and foreign loans. In his thirties during the 1819-1825 period, he is a handsome, capable banker whose grandfather raised the Earl of St James, creating a lasting bond of gratitude between the families. His bank survives the catastrophic banking crisis of 1825 through a combination of the Earl's financial backing and the clever resourcefulness of his clerk <a href="characters/Eugene-Penny-1801.html">Eugene Penny</a>.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Described as "a handsome gentleman in his thirties" when Eugene Penny first meets him in 1819.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Meredith is an affable, competent banker who treats his employees with kindness and respect. He puts Eugene at ease during their first interview, speaking pleasantly about business before making inquiries. He demonstrates good judgment in hiring and shows trust in his employees, entrusting Eugene with delicate matters requiring discretion.</p>

<p>He is prudent in his business approach, following the lead of established houses like Baring's and Rothschild's while avoiding wilder speculation. He declines loans to manufacturers, preferring to stick with what he understands: commercial loans to merchants in import and export trade. Though his bank participates in lucrative South American loan syndicates, he carefully avoids the riskiest ventures, declining Colombia and Peru while accepting Buenos Aires, Brazil, and Mexico.</p>

<p>Meredith displays both pride and humility in his relationship with the Earl of St James. Despite owing his start to the Earl's backing, he is reluctant to ask for help during the 1825 crisis, knowing the Earl has already done much for him and has explicitly stated he won't bail him out again. This shows a mixture of independence and proper respect for boundaries.</p>

<p>He runs a warm household, treating his clerks almost like family. Eugene Penny lives in Meredith's house for his first two years, becoming "like an elder brother to Meredith's four boisterous children." The banker and his wife are perceptive enough to recognize that Eugene is "secretly in love with pretty Mrs Meredith," showing their understanding and good humor.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1819-hiring-eugene-penny'>1819: Hiring Eugene Penny</h3>

<p>In 1819, Meredith interviews <a href="characters/Eugene-Penny-1801.html">Eugene Penny</a> for a position at his bank, arranged through <a href="characters/Jeremy-Fleming-1770.html">Jeremy Fleming</a>. The interview takes place in a comfortable parlor off the first landing of Meredith's Bank, a tall brick house in a narrow courtyard off Cornhill. The <a href="characters/Earl-St-James-1859.html">Earl of St James</a> observes the interview from a wing chair.</p>

<p>Meredith carefully assesses Eugene's knowledge and character, asking about his family's Huguenot origins and his ambitions. He expresses satisfaction with the Huguenot connection, noting "there are many Huguenots in finance you know. They do well." He emphasizes that advancement depends on usefulness: "It'll all depend upon how useful you can make yourself, you know. All of us here are free to rise – or fall."</p>

<p>When the Earl abruptly tests Eugene on his views about free trade and the gold standard, Meredith smoothly facilitates the exchange. Eugene's sophisticated answers on these contentious economic issues secure him the position.</p>

<h3 id='1819-1822-running-the-bank'>1819-1822: Running the Bank</h3>

<p>Meredith runs his bank in the traditional medieval style, with the counting-house on the ground floor and his family and junior clerks living above, "just like apprentices." The bank holds balances for country gentlemen and makes commercial loans primarily to merchants in import and export trade through short-term loans for cargoes, letters of credit, and the discounting of bills.</p>

<p>During this period, business is challenging due to the return to the gold standard, which has tightened credit and made merchants jittery. Meredith instructs his clerks to seek "specialist merchants; they often survive." The bank participates in the lucrative foreign loan business, joining syndicates for massive loans to foreign governments. By 1820, Meredith notes that Baring's, one of the leaders in this business, is "slipping" because the younger generation is not paying sufficient attention to details.</p>

<p>Eugene Penny lives in Meredith's house during his first two years, becoming integrated into the family. Meredith shows trust in Eugene, eventually confiding in him about the bank's business and entrusting him with delicate tasks.</p>

<h3 id='1822-the-st-james-affair'>1822: The St James Affair</h3>

<p>In December 1822, when the <a href="characters/Earl-St-James-1859.html">Earl of St James</a> is arrested for refusing to pay inflated parish rates for St Pancras, Meredith immediately determines to pay them himself: "God knows, George, I owe him everything." However, the payment must be done discreetly so the proud Earl won't know they interfered.</p>

<p>Meredith assigns Eugene to handle this delicate matter. Eugene successfully arranges for the Earl's release by presenting the payment as coming from "unnamed well-wishers in the parish," preventing both the Earl's imprisonment and any embarrassment to the old man.</p>

<h3 id='1824-1825-the-banking-crisis'>1824-1825: The Banking Crisis</h3>

<p>By 1824, Eugene has begun to notice vulnerabilities in the bank's position. Though Meredith has been prudent, avoiding manufacturing loans and following the conservative lead of Rothschild's and Baring's in shunning stock speculation, the bank remains exposed to general market conditions. Meredith acknowledges this: "Our own positions are pretty sound. But what I do fear is a general decline. It's very hard for a small bank like ours to protect against that."</p>

<p>He explains the true danger to Eugene: "But the real danger is not so specific. It isn't a bad investment or a shaky loan – it's nothing you can even predict. It's loss of confidence. That's what can kill us."</p>

<p>In autumn 1825, as the Bank of England tightens credit, Meredith recognizes the approaching storm: "Batten down the hatches, Penny. I think we're in for a storm." He prepares thoroughly, meeting with all major clients and accumulating twenty thousand pounds in gold sovereigns – "It'll have to," he mutters when Eugene suggests this should be sufficient.</p>

<h3 id='december-1825-surviving-the-panic'>December 1825: Surviving the Panic</h3>

<p>On December 7, 1825, when multiple banks begin to fail, Meredith's preparations initially hold. Few customers withdraw money in the morning, and one merchant even deposits a thousand pounds, having taken it out of the failing Williams's bank because he considers Meredith's "safer."</p>

<p>Just before closing time, disaster strikes. An elderly country gentleman named Grimsdyke from Cumberland – "one of my first depositors" whom Meredith had "almost forgotten what he looks like" – arrives after traveling all night and withdraws twenty thousand pounds, wiping out the bank's entire gold reserve.</p>

<p>When Meredith and Eugene examine the books that evening, Meredith concludes: "We can't get through another day." He explains that three shaky clients owe too much, any of whom could fail. He can raise another five thousand in cash, but this will only last until noon the next day. The Bank of England won't help – "We're too small for them to bother about."</p>

<p>When Eugene suggests approaching the Earl of St James, Meredith is anguished: "I can't. He's done so much for me already. Besides, he already told me he'll never bail me out." His pride and sense of proper boundaries make him refuse, but he allows Eugene to go on his own initiative.</p>

<p>Eugene travels to Brighton that evening, where the Earl is staying with the King. Despite Eugene's lie about the bank's solvency (said "with total conviction although he knew it was a lie"), the Earl agrees to lend ten thousand pounds at 10 percent interest, arriving in London the next day.</p>

<p>However, this appears too late. By mid-morning, with two thousand pounds left and withdrawals occurring at a thousand pounds per hour, Meredith tells Eugene: "By noon, it'll be over." He cannot close the doors until the Earl's money arrives in late afternoon, as doing so would trigger a devastating run.</p>

<p>Eugene devises a brilliant stratagem: take the remaining two thousand pounds to the Bank of England and exchange it for small change. For the rest of the day, "a now cool-as-cucumber Meredith" addresses waiting customers, apologizing that "the Bank has sent us only change" but assuring them "You shall all be paid." Two clerks slowly count out shillings, sixpences, and mostly pennies, reducing the outflow to only three hundred pounds per hour.</p>

<p>When the Earl arrives just before closing with ten thousand in gold, he finds most depositors drifting away "out of sheer boredom." The bank is saved. From that day forward, "for many years after, the City would say of Meredith's: 'They pay; but you only get pennies there.'"</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='the-earl-of-st-james'>The Earl of St James</h3>

<p>Meredith's relationship with the Earl is defined by profound gratitude and proper boundaries. His grandfather raised the young Earl after he was "rescued" from Seven Dials and returned to his proper station (the Earl was actually <a href="characters/Sep-Dogget-1742.html">Sam Dogget</a>, switched at birth). As a debt of gratitude, the Earl staked Meredith when he started his bank, making the bank's existence possible.</p>

<p>The Earl still likes to "drop by from time to time" as the business seems to amuse him. He even participates in Eugene Penny's hiring interview, testing the young man's knowledge of free trade and the gold standard from his wing chair.</p>

<p>Despite this supportive relationship, Meredith is acutely aware of boundaries. When the bank faces ruin in 1825, he refuses to approach the Earl: "He's done so much for me already. Besides, he already told me he'll never bail me out." Only when Eugene volunteers to go independently does Meredith permit it.</p>

<h3 id='eugene-penny'>Eugene Penny</h3>

<p>Meredith's relationship with <a href="characters/Eugene-Penny-1801.html">Eugene Penny</a> evolves from employer to trusted confidant. He initially hires Eugene based on a good interview and the Earl's approval, then houses the young man in his home for two years. He recognizes Eugene's abilities and increasingly trusts him with sensitive matters.</p>

<p>After Eugene discreetly handles the Earl's parish rates affair in 1822, Meredith begins "entrusting him with a number of tasks needing discretion" and confiding in him about the bank's business. By 1825, Eugene has "attained some seniority in the firm" and serves as Meredith's closest adviser during the banking crisis.</p>

<p>The relationship shows Meredith's good judgment in recognizing talent and his willingness to mentor and promote capable employees. Eugene's loyalty and resourcefulness during the 1825 crisis justify this trust completely.</p>

<h3 id='george-de-quette'>George de Quette</h3>

<p>Meredith knows <a href="characters/George-de-Quette-1805.html">George de Quette</a>, the Earl's grandson, well enough to greet him familiarly and introduce him to Eugene at Mendoza's boxing saloon. When George comes to the counting-house in December 1822 because the Earl has been arrested, Meredith immediately agrees to pay the rates: "God knows, George, I owe him everything." Their relationship appears friendly and cooperative, united by loyalty to the Earl.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Meredith operates during a tumultuous period in British financial history. The return to the gold standard in 1819, after years of unbacked currency during the Napoleonic Wars, creates the exact problems Eugene warned about in his interview: reduced currency in circulation, falling prices, difficulty obtaining credit, and threatened collapse of the system.</p>

<p>Private banking houses like Meredith's occupy a critical but vulnerable position in the financial system. These small family banks make commercial loans to merchants, hold deposits for country gentlemen, and participate in syndicated foreign loans. They have no central bank backing and depend entirely on confidence and careful management.</p>

<p>The foreign loan boom of the early 1820s represents the emergence of Britain as the world's financial center: "Money knows no boundaries, Eugene. After all, in times past the Lombards and other foreigners lent money to England. Now it's our turn to be the bankers." But this boom also creates dangerous speculation and overvaluation.</p>

<p>The banking crisis of December 1825 represents a classic depression caused by contracting the money supply – exactly what Eugene and City leaders like Rothschild had warned Parliament about. When Pole's bank fails on December 7th, linked to forty country banks, panic spreads instantly. By Thursday, the Bank of England is "dropping all its severity" and "bailing out every financial house in sight." By Friday, even the Bank of England has run out of bullion and must be saved by Nathan Rothschild.</p>

<p>Meredith's survival depends partly on luck (the fog that keeps customers away), partly on the Earl's backing, partly on Eugene's cleverness, and partly on Thursday's general bailout by the Bank of England, backed by the Duke of Wellington himself. Small banks without such advantages perish in droves.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Meredith embodies the solid, competent middle class of early 19th-century London – the merchant bankers who financed Britain's commercial expansion while maintaining traditional values of prudence, gratitude, and family loyalty. Unlike the great houses like Baring's (declining due to aristocratic complacency) or the aggressive new houses taking wild risks, Meredith represents the careful middle way: participating in profitable ventures but avoiding excessive speculation, trusting capable employees but maintaining oversight, accepting help when necessary but avoiding dependency.</p>

<p>His grandfather's role in raising the Earl of St James creates an unusual cross-class connection that proves crucial to the bank's survival. This illustrates the novel's recurring theme of hidden connections and obligations spanning generations – the Earl, born a Dogget but raised to believe himself an aristocrat, repays his adoptive family by backing Meredith's bank, which in turn survives to employ Eugene Penny, creating opportunities across class boundaries.</p>

<p>The banking crisis tests Meredith's character in multiple ways. His reluctance to seek help from the Earl shows both pride and proper respect for boundaries. His trust in Eugene to handle the crisis demonstrates good judgment in delegation. His calm performance during the "pennies" stratagem shows grace under pressure. The crisis reveals that even competent, prudent bankers cannot fully protect against systemic collapse – they also need luck, connections, and clever subordinates.</p>

<p>Meredith's bank also represents the transition from medieval to modern financial organization. The physical layout – living quarters above the counting-house, junior clerks housed like apprentices – belongs to an older world. But the business itself – foreign loan syndicates, futures trading, bills of exchange, letters of credit – represents emerging modern finance. Meredith operates at this intersection, maintaining traditional personal relationships while participating in the impersonal global capital markets that are transforming London into the world's financial center.</p>
