<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Isobel Dogget is one half of the famous "Dogget sisters," identical twin prostitutes working at the Dog's Head brothel in Southwark in 1295. Known throughout Southwark for being completely indistinguishable from her twin <a href="characters/Margery-Dogget-1270.html">Margery</a>, Isobel is a kind-hearted and adventurous woman who helps orchestrate an elaborate plan to save an innocent girl from prosecution. She is the regular companion of Alderman <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a>, whose child she conceives during the events of the chapter.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Isobel is described as tall and stringy with thick tresses of black hair, big black eyes, and big buck teeth. Her voice, when she laughs, makes a surprisingly deep sound like a donkey's braying. Despite these unconventional features, she possesses a remarkable sexuality, with a slim body and rather heavy breasts. Most distinctively, she has a streak of white hair over the center of her forehead in her black tresses - a feature shared with her identical twin.</p>

<p>She dresses identically to Margery, making it impossible for anyone, including their own brothelkeeper, to tell them apart. She owns at least one fine red silk nightgown that almost exposes the breasts and has a long slit up one side - her "best gown" which she lends to Joan during their scheme.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Isobel is fundamentally kind-hearted, as demonstrated by her willingness to help a complete stranger in distress. When she and Margery encounter Joan in tears outside St Paul's, they immediately take her under their wing and devise an elaborate plan to save Joan's fiancé from execution. Their motto appears to be spontaneous generosity: "We must help her," they say together upon learning Joan's plight.</p>

<p>Above all, Isobel loves adventure. The riskier and more elaborate a scheme, the better. She and her sister thrive on intrigue and excitement, approaching even dangerous situations with cheerful boldness. Her characterization as "irrepressible" and "cheerful" reflects a resilient spirit that refuses to be ground down by her circumstances.</p>

<p>Isobel possesses a notable religious sensibility, which sets her apart from what might be expected of someone in her profession. She prays regularly and believes that God might forgive her sins and that she will ultimately be saved. She understands the Church's contradictory position toward prostitutes - they can receive communion but must be buried in unconsecrated ground - and accepts this paradox while maintaining her faith.</p>

<p>She demonstrates loyalty and courage when confronted by authority. When Dionysius Silversleeves tries to force Joan to service him, Isobel stands up to him directly, calling him "pimple face" despite the risk that the bishop could fine her for such insubordination. Her harsh voice rings out angrily in defense of the vulnerable girl, showing moral courage that transcends her station.</p>

<p>Isobel is also remarkably clever and resourceful. Working in concert with her sister, she concocts elaborate plans on the spot, using their identical appearance as a tactical advantage. The scheme to protect Joan's virginity while deceiving two wealthy men requires quick thinking, perfect timing, and flawless execution - all of which Isobel provides.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='background-and-family-history'>Background and Family History</h3>

<p>Isobel and Margery Dogget descended from Adam Ducket, who lost his freedom of London eighty years earlier when the Barnikel family rejected him after he was caught stealing. In his bitterness, Adam refused help from the Barnikels and drifted to Southwark, where within a generation his proud family of modest London citizens had sunk into the underclass. The sisters belonged to a family of five with a dozen cousins, all living in Southwark and all "without exception, cheerful, irrepressible, and disreputable."</p>

<p>The sisters' professional name derives from their association with their particular whorehouse. So well known were they as "the Dog's Head girls" that this gradually transformed into "Dogget," a name they accepted cheerfully even as some of their Ducket relatives preferred the distancing of the family name from their scandalous reputation.</p>

<h3 id='life-at-the-dogs-head-by-1295'>Life at the Dog's Head (by 1295)</h3>

<p>By 1295, Isobel and Margery had established themselves as fixtures at the Dog's Head, a middling-sized brothel along Bankside in Southwark. The entire area, including all eighteen brothels, belonged to the Bishop of Winchester and was known as the Liberty of the Clink. The sisters rented rooms side by side and worked together, sometimes entertaining clients as a trio for a modest discount, in parties that could last all night if the customer had the stamina.</p>

<p>Isobel had a regular customer: Alderman <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a>, who visited the Dog's Head once a week for nearly five years, always sleeping with one of the Dogget sisters. The fact that Barnikel could never tell them apart added an ironic twist - given that his ancestor had been the one to destroy the original Ducket family's fortunes.</p>

<h3 id='november-1295-the-virgin-deception'>November 1295: The Virgin Deception</h3>

<p>Two days before the events of the main story, Isobel and Margery encountered Joan, a fifteen-year-old craftsman's daughter, in floods of tears outside St Paul's. Learning that Joan's fiancé Martin Fleming faced execution for breaking curfew, and that Joan was willing to pose as a prostitute to invoke special legal protection for him, the sisters were intrigued and immediately agreed to help. They devised a plan for Joan to claim to be a prostitute, which would allow her to invoke an obscure legal right to save Martin at the gallows.</p>

<p>The plan required Joan to prove she was truly a prostitute by spending time at the brothel and being vouched for by the sisters. However, a complication arose when Margery discovered a sore that appeared to be "the burning sickness" (likely syphilis or another venereal disease). Knowing that the bishop's monthly inspections were thorough and would result in expulsion, the sisters visited a discreet doctor in Maiden Lane who gave Margery an ointment and confirmed their fears: "It's a leprosy," as all such contagious sores were called.</p>

<p>This medical crisis caused the sisters to momentarily forget about Joan, leaving her vulnerable when customers arrived. When a message about a virgin came to the brothel, both Dionysius Silversleeves and Alderman Barnikel arrived seeking this rare prize.</p>

<h3 id='the-confrontation-and-switch'>The Confrontation and Switch</h3>

<p>When Silversleeves arrived after curfew demanding Joan, Isobel boldly confronted him. Standing up from her bench, she declared in her harsh voice: "She's sick. Leave her alone, pimple face." Despite the brothelkeeper's reluctance to cross Silversleeves, Isobel showed no fear of the bishop's clerk and his authority to levy fines.</p>

<p>When the brothelkeeper finally ordered Isobel to fetch Joan, she went to the attic room where Joan and Margery were preparing for the next day's ordeal. The three women faced a crisis: if Joan serviced Silversleeves, she would no longer be a virgin and their entire plan would fail. The sisters sat together on a mattress "with their chins resting on their hands" and thought. After much muttering and a pair of hoarse laughs, they devised a new plan.</p>

<p>The sisters kept Silversleeves distracted at a table with food and wine - stew-houses were not supposed to sell these, but Silversleeves had money to spare. While one sister poured wine and urged him to eat beef and apple tart, the other slipped away and returned. Then "she" came down dressed in Isobel's best red silk nightgown, walked boldly to Silversleeves, sat on his knee, and announced "I'm hungry."</p>

<p>The deception worked perfectly. In the darkness of the bedchamber, Silversleeves believed he was with Joan, but he was actually with one of the Dogget sisters - specifically Margery, as would later become apparent. Meanwhile, the real Joan's virginity remained intact for the crucial next day.</p>

<h3 id='the-gallows-and-wedding'>The Gallows and Wedding</h3>

<p>The following day, Joan successfully invoked her legal right as a supposed prostitute to marry Martin Fleming at the gallows, saving him from execution. The spectacle was unprecedented, and after <a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a> and Alderman Barnikel secured the king's intervention, Martin and Joan were married at a small church. Isobel and Margery acted as bridesmaids in what the priest thought was the most remarkable wedding he had ever seen. Notably, Martin Fleming was "the only man in the church that day who had never slept with either of the Dogget sisters."</p>

<h3 id='pilgrimage-and-aftermath-late-1295'>Pilgrimage and Aftermath (Late 1295)</h3>

<p>Isobel and Margery left London the next day on pilgrimage to Canterbury - a reason for absence that even the bishop could not quarrel with. This served a dual purpose: religious devotion (which Isobel took seriously) and giving Margery time away from the monthly inspections while her sore healed. The pilgrimage proved fortuitous, as Margery's ointment appeared to be working by the time they returned.</p>

<h3 id='christmas-1295-pregnancy-discovered'>Christmas 1295: Pregnancy Discovered</h3>

<p>By Christmas, when Parliament had successfully concluded its business and Alderman Barnikel had given a passionate and loyal speech helping to secure generous taxes for the king, Isobel came to a realization: "I'm definitely pregnant and I'm sure it's him," she told Margery. Given that Barnikel had been her regular customer for five years, visiting weekly, this was a reasonable conclusion.</p>

<p>The timing was somewhat ironic, as just after Christmas, Dionysius Silversleeves began experiencing a burning sensation in his private parts - the consequence of his night with Margery, not Isobel, who had been confused with her sister in the darkness of the brothel.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='margery-dogget'>Margery Dogget</h3>

<p>Isobel's relationship with her identical twin is the most important in her life. The two are essentially inseparable, described as sharing identical conversation, dressing identically, and living side by side. They work together professionally, think together, and conspire together. Their mental connection is so complete that they can sit in silence and then emerge with a fully formed plan, as if they share one mind. The text emphasizes that no one can tell them apart - "whether it was Isobel who had suggested it to Margery, or the other way round" - suggesting their identities are so merged that even the distinction between them becomes meaningless. When Margery faces the threat of disease and expulsion, Isobel prays and helps her sister navigate the crisis, showing deep sisterly loyalty.</p>

<h3 id='waldus-barnikel'>Waldus Barnikel</h3>

<p>Alderman <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a> had been visiting the Dog's Head once a week for nearly five years by 1295, always sleeping with one of the Dogget sisters. He was "as constant as he was regular," suggesting a relationship that, while commercial, had developed a certain comfortable routine. Isobel bore his child, conceived around the time of the November 1295 events, and discovered her pregnancy by Christmas.</p>

<p>There is dramatic irony in this relationship: Barnikel's family had been responsible for the downfall of Adam Ducket eighty years earlier, leading to the degradation of his line into the underclass that produced the Dogget sisters. Now a Barnikel would unknowingly father a child with a descendant of the man his family had destroyed. The text notes that Barnikel could never tell the twins apart, adding another layer of irony - he may have been sleeping with either sister on any given week.</p>

<h3 id='joan'>Joan</h3>

<p>Though they had never met before finding her in tears outside St Paul's, Isobel and Margery immediately took Joan under their protection. Isobel showed genuine care for the young girl's welfare, defending her from Silversleeves and risking her own standing at the brothel. She went to great lengths to protect Joan's virginity, which was essential to the plan's success. The relationship demonstrates Isobel's capacity for spontaneous kindness toward strangers and her willingness to take risks for those in need.</p>

<h3 id='the-brothelkeeper'>The Brothelkeeper</h3>

<p>Isobel had a typical employer-employee relationship with the brothelkeeper of the Dog's Head. He knew the sisters' commercial value and generally deferred to them, but when pressed by someone with authority like Silversleeves, he would not protect them. Isobel understood these power dynamics but was willing to defy them when principles were at stake.</p>

<h3 id='dionysius-silversleeves'>Dionysius Silversleeves</h3>

<p>Isobel had no apparent prior relationship with <a href="characters/Dionysius-Silversleeves-1266.html">Dionysius Silversleeves</a>, the bishop's clerk with pockmarked face and social pretensions. When he arrived demanding Joan, Isobel openly confronted him, showing neither fear nor respect. She called him "pimple face" despite knowing he could fine her through the bishop's authority. Her harsh, angry voice when defending Joan revealed contempt for Silversleeves' bullying behavior. The ultimate joke was that he believed he had conquered a virgin when in reality he had been with Margery (or possibly Isobel - the text suggests it was Margery), who gave him a venereal disease for his troubles.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Isobel Dogget lived and worked in the Liberty of the Clink, the Bishop of Winchester's controlled territory in Southwark, where prostitution was legal, regulated, and profitable for the Church. The paradox of Church-run brothels - where prostitutes could receive communion but must be buried in unconsecrated ground - defined the moral landscape of her world. Isobel's religious faith existed within this contradiction, suggesting a practical medieval spirituality that accepted such institutional hypocrisy as a fact of life.</p>

<p>The reign of Edward I (1272-1307) provided the backdrop for the story. Edward was expanding his parliamentary system, calling burgesses from major towns to grant him taxes - hence Barnikel's presence at Parliament. The king's authority and justice system play a crucial role in the plot, as Joan and Martin's salvation ultimately depends on royal intervention secured by influential men.</p>

<p>Southwark had long been "a place apart" since Roman times, a refuge for vagrants and those in trouble with the law. The eighteen brothels along Bankside were a well-established institution, operating under regulations first drawn up in the reign of Henry II with the assistance of Thomas Becket himself. Prostitutes were known as "Winchester Geese," and similar regulations applied to the official brothels in Cock's Lane near St Bartholomew's within London proper.</p>

<p>Isobel's family history reflects the social precarity of medieval urban life. A single mistake or misfortune - in Adam Ducket's case, a theft and loss of London freedom - could plunge a respectable family into the underclass within a single generation. The mobility worked in reverse as well; some Southwark residents could be "highly respectable," as the text notes when mentioning unrelated Doggets, showing the complex social geography of the area.</p>

<p>The chapter takes place in November 1295 during a Parliamentary session, reflecting Edward I's systematic use of representative assemblies to strengthen royal power while extracting taxes. The specific mention that the brothels were to be "officially closed" during Parliament suggests an attempt to present a respectable face to the assembled burgesses, though discreet services were still arranged.</p>

<p>Venereal disease was a constant threat in Isobel's profession. The bishop's monthly inspections by a bailiff and assistants were thorough, and any girl found with disease was expelled from the Liberty. The text indicates this was "one of the advantages of the Church running the brothels" - that the inspections maintained standards. The doctor's reference to such sores as "a leprosy" reflects medieval medical terminology that conflated various contagious skin conditions.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Isobel Dogget embodies several key themes in <em>London</em>'s narrative. Most prominently, she represents the resilience and adaptability of London's underclass. Despite her circumstances, she maintains dignity, humor, faith, and moral courage. Her willingness to help a stranger at personal risk demonstrates that virtue and vice are not determined by social status or occupation.</p>

<p>The theme of identity runs through Isobel's story. She and Margery are so indistinguishable that the narrative itself often cannot separate them: "whether it was Isobel who had suggested it to Margery, or the other way round." This merger of identity serves both practical purposes (their deception of clients) and symbolic ones (suggesting the erasure of individuality that can come with social marginalization). Yet within this merged identity, Isobel maintains her own character trait - her particular religious devotion - that distinguishes her from her sister.</p>

<p>Isobel's pregnancy by Waldus Barnikel represents the theme of historical irony and the interconnectedness of London's families across generations. The Barnikels destroyed the Duckets; now a Barnikel unknowingly fathers a child with a Ducket descendant. This circular pattern of family fortunes rising and falling, intersecting and diverging, recurs throughout <em>London</em>. The child conceived in 1295 would carry both the blood of the oppressor and the oppressed, embodying London's complicated social history.</p>

<p>The character illuminates the medieval Church's relationship with sexuality and sin. Isobel's sincere religious faith coexists with her profession, and she navigates the Church's contradictory rules with practical wisdom. She can receive communion but will be buried in unconsecrated ground; she works in a bishop-owned brothel subject to episcopal regulations; she goes on pilgrimage to Canterbury as both a religious act and a practical necessity. This paradox reflects the medieval Church's pragmatic accommodation of human nature alongside its moral strictures.</p>

<p>Isobel's story also explores the theme of female solidarity and ingenuity. Working outside the protection of family or guild, the Dogget sisters create their own support network. When they encounter Joan in distress, they immediately conspire to help her, devising elaborate plans that outwit wealthier, more powerful men. The scheme to protect Joan's virginity while deceiving Silversleeves demonstrates the intelligence and resourcefulness available to women even in constrained circumstances.</p>

<p>Finally, Isobel represents the theme of London's geography of vice and virtue. Southwark, across the river from respectable London, serves as both margin and mirror. The "place apart" allows for activities forbidden or restricted within the city walls, yet the people there maintain their own codes of honor and community. Isobel's kindness to Joan, her religious devotion, and her loyalty to her sister all demonstrate that moral geography is more complex than the simple divide between the City and Southwark, between the respectable and the disreputable.</p>
