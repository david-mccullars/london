<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Ben Carpenter is a solemn and deeply religious craftsman who courts Amy Fleming, daughter of the grocer John Fleming and Dame Barnikel. Characterized by his patience, discipline, and brooding nature, Carpenter becomes involved in the ideological currents of his time—particularly the religious reforms of John Wyclif and the social upheaval of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Despite his earnest devotion to both spiritual and social justice, his obsessive tendencies and susceptibility to radical ideas lead him into dangerous situations, ultimately causing those around him to question whether he is a stable partner for Amy.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Ben Carpenter has a distinctive and somewhat ungainly appearance. He has bandy legs and a head that appears too large for his stocky body. His most notable feature is his large, round face with solemn eyes that give him a perpetually serious expression. Dame Barnikel finds him physically unappealing and "moonfaced," while his overall bearing suggests a man weighed down by thought rather than animated by joy.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Ben Carpenter is defined above all by his profound seriousness and capacity for patience. His practice of archery demonstrates extraordinary discipline: he can stand perfectly still in shooting position for an hour, his arm extended and rigid, back straight, waiting with infinite patience. This same quality of intense, sustained focus characterizes his approach to religion and social questions.</p>

<p>Carpenter is deeply thoughtful about spiritual matters, drawn to the reformist teachings of John Wyclif and the radical preaching of John Ball. Unlike most Londoners who cheerfully agree with Wyclif's criticisms of Church corruption, Carpenter broods over these issues seriously. He turns everything over in his mind during the long hours of his archery practice and woodwork. This reflective nature, however, borders on obsession. As Amy notes, "Carpenter brooded too much."</p>

<p>His loyalty and conviction, while admirable in some respects, make him vulnerable to radical movements. When he joins the peasant army at Blackheath, he genuinely believes the rebels are loyal subjects who have come to help the young king "set the world to rights." His faith in the righteousness of the cause is so complete that he becomes animated—more so than usual—and assures the skeptical <a href="characters/Geoffrey-Ducket-1361.html">Geoffrey Ducket</a> that "everything will be all right."</p>

<p>Carpenter's most concerning trait is a tendency toward zealotry that manifests as dream-like behavior in moments of crisis. At the Savoy Palace, watching the building burn, he murmurs repeatedly, "Yes, it must go. This is what must happen," before walking into the flames "as though in a dream," nearly costing him his life. This incident reveals a man whose convictions can overwhelm his sense of self-preservation.</p>

<p>Despite these troubling tendencies, Carpenter is fundamentally decent and means no harm. He courts Amy faithfully and respectfully. His father-in-law-to-be, John Fleming, likes him—a significant endorsement. Yet even Amy, who remains loyal to him, wonders privately whether his obsessions might lead them into trouble.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='c-1377-1380-apprenticeship-and-courtship'>c. 1377-1380: Apprenticeship and Courtship</h3>

<p>As a young apprentice carpenter, Ben begins courting Amy Fleming. Their relationship develops slowly over the course of several years. Amy's mother, Dame Barnikel, strongly disapproves, finding Carpenter dull and physically unattractive. She tells Amy bluntly: "This carpenter. He won't do at all." More worryingly, Dame Barnikel suggests Carpenter is "moonstruck" and "not right in the head," predicting Amy would become a laughing stock if she married him.</p>

<p>Despite Dame Barnikel's objections, John Fleming takes a liking to the solemn craftsman, and out of respect for her husband's opinion, Dame Barnikel does not send Carpenter packing. Amy herself is drawn to Carpenter's quiet strength and steadiness, seeing him as secure and reliable compared to the more carefree Geoffrey Ducket.</p>

<p>Carpenter is distantly related to Amy through the Painter-Fleming family connections. One of the grandsons of the saddle painter whose daughter had rescued the Fleming boy generations earlier had become a carpenter and taken his occupation as his surname, creating the Carpenter branch of the family.</p>

<h3 id='1380-religious-awakening'>1380: Religious Awakening</h3>

<p>In the spring of 1380, Amy notices that Carpenter has something on his mind. When he finally confides in her, she learns he is worried about God. Carpenter has been deeply affected by the teachings of John Wyclif, the Oxford scholar who challenges Church authority and advocates for an English translation of the Bible.</p>

<p>Unlike most Londoners who cheerfully agree with Wyclif's criticisms of corrupt clergy, Carpenter thinks about these matters with intense seriousness. During his long hours of archery practice and woodwork, he turns everything over in his mind. He becomes convinced that "something bad is going to happen" and that "God will probably send a sign." Despite his dark forebodings, he continues to court Amy steadily, and she knows she can rely on him, even if she worries that he broods too much.</p>

<h3 id='june-1381-the-peasants-revolt'>June 1381: The Peasants' Revolt</h3>

<p>When the Peasants' Revolt erupts in response to the oppressive poll tax, Carpenter joins the rebel army from Kent gathering at Blackheath. <a href="characters/Geoffrey-Ducket-1361.html">Geoffrey Ducket</a>, sent by an anxious Amy to find him, discovers Carpenter among the Kentish craftsmen. To Ducket's surprise, Carpenter is more animated than usual, delighted to see his friend and eager to introduce him to the cause.</p>

<p>Carpenter genuinely believes the peasants are loyal subjects who have come to save the kingdom. He assures Ducket that the young King Richard II is coming to parley, and "once he's heard us, everything will be all right." When Ducket suggests returning home to reassure Amy and Dame Barnikel (who is preparing to defend the George Inn against the "rebel horde"), Carpenter only laughs, insisting these good people mean no harm.</p>

<p>At Blackheath, Carpenter is profoundly moved by John Ball's famous sermon on equality. As Ball proclaims "Pride reigneth in palaces. Government is gluttony. Lawyers are lechers," Ducket sees Carpenter beside him nodding and muttering: "This is true. This is just." When Ball delivers his famous couplet—"When Adam delved and Eve span / Who was then the gentleman?"—Carpenter's eyes shine solemnly with conviction.</p>

<h3 id='the-savoy-palace-incident'>The Savoy Palace Incident</h3>

<p>After the king's parley fails and the peasant army enters London, Carpenter insists on remaining with them despite Ducket's pleas to turn back. As they witness the burning of John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace, Carpenter watches with "a dazed look on his face, murmuring from time to time: 'Yes, it must go. This is what must happen.'"</p>

<p>Then, inexplicably, Carpenter walks into the burning courtyard "as though in a dream" or "as though hypnotized." Unlike the looters tearing goods from the flames, he makes no move to steal anything; he simply walks toward the fire, drawn by the flames themselves. It is bad luck that the building collapses just as Ducket arrives. Carpenter falls and is knocked unconscious. Ducket heroically drags him out, saving his life, though both are considerably burned in the process.</p>

<p>Carpenter is taken to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he recovers from burns and a massive bump on his head. When he returns to the George, he shows no change in his convictions, insisting that it was "London ruffians who did the looting" and maintaining that "we still live under a godless authority. One day it will have to change."</p>

<h3 id='1382-the-lollard-bible'>1382: The Lollard Bible</h3>

<p>During the Easter season of 1382, copies of Wyclif's English Bible—the so-called Lollard Bible—are infiltrated into London. To men like <a href="characters/Gilbert-Bull-1330.html">Gilbert Bull</a>, an English Bible means sedition, especially with John Ball's radical sermons still fresh in memory. The idea of common folk reading the Bible for themselves strikes terror in the hearts of responsible men.</p>

<p>Ben Carpenter eagerly seeks a Lollard Bible. He manages to obtain the Book of Genesis, prefixed by Lollard tracts. He reads both tract and scripture slowly but successfully, going through them twice. Though he doesn't bring it to the George (Amy says it would annoy her mother, who has ceased to like Wyclif since the revolt), Carpenter conducts Amy to quiet spots where he reads her chapters. He promises: "When the weather's warmer, we can walk out in the evenings and I can read it to you for longer."</p>

<p>This development causes Amy further concern about whether Carpenter's obsessions will lead them into trouble. The Lollard movement is increasingly dangerous, and possession of an English Bible could bring serious consequences.</p>

<h3 id='marriage-to-amy'>Marriage to Amy</h3>

<p>Shortly before Christmas in 1382, Carpenter announces to Amy: "I think we might marry in the summer." However, after John Fleming's death from drinking poisoned wine (intended for someone else), Amy and Carpenter agree to postpone the wedding out of respect. Carpenter himself suggests they consider autumn instead.</p>

<p>During this period, Amy privately reconsiders her commitment to Carpenter. Her father's dying note strongly endorses Ducket, urging trust in the brave young man who tried to save him. Amy reflects on the events of the previous year—"Carpenter at the Savoy; Carpenter with his Lollard texts"—and wonders whether the solemn craftsman's obsessions will lead them into trouble. She contrasts this with Ducket's reliability: he had saved both Carpenter and Fleming, or tried to. Nevertheless, Amy initially keeps her doubts to herself.</p>

<p>When Amy finally confides to <a href="characters/Tiffany-Bull-1365.html">Tiffany Bull</a> that she's "planning to ditch my man Carpenter," the two young women bond over their shared marital uncertainties. However, the text confirms that Amy does eventually marry Carpenter. Dame Barnikel announces on the eve of her daughter's wedding to Carpenter that she herself will marry James Bull, and the wedding proceeds as planned, likely in 1383.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='amy-fleming'>Amy Fleming</h3>

<p>Carpenter's relationship with Amy is characterized by patient, steady courtship over several years. He courts her faithfully and respectfully, and she appreciates his quiet strength and reliability. However, their relationship lacks passion or deep understanding. Amy admits to <a href="characters/Tiffany-Bull-1365.html">Tiffany Bull</a>: "I know I do not love Carpenter, but he had always seemed secure."</p>

<p>The events of 1381 strain their relationship significantly. Carpenter's involvement in the Peasants' Revolt and his near-death at the Savoy Palace frighten Amy, as does his possession of a Lollard Bible and his continued adherence to radical religious and political views. She worries that "the solemn craftsman's obsessions" will lead them into trouble, yet she ultimately marries him, perhaps out of a sense of commitment or lack of better alternatives once Ducket marries Tiffany.</p>

<h3 id='geoffrey-ducket'>Geoffrey Ducket</h3>

<p>Carpenter maintains a friendly relationship with <a href="characters/Geoffrey-Ducket-1361.html">Geoffrey Ducket</a>, Fleming's apprentice. The three young people—Carpenter, Amy, and Ducket—often walk out together to places like Clapham or Battersea, or go swimming in the Thames on warm summer afternoons. Ducket accompanies Carpenter and Amy to Finsbury Fields to watch Carpenter practice archery.</p>

<p>During the Peasants' Revolt, Carpenter is delighted to see Ducket at Blackheath and eagerly tries to share his enthusiasm for the cause. Later, Ducket saves Carpenter's life by dragging him from the burning Savoy Palace, suffering burns himself in the process. Despite this heroic rescue, Carpenter shows no change in his radical convictions, suggesting he doesn't fully appreciate the danger he was in or the sacrifice Ducket made.</p>

<h3 id='dame-barnikel'>Dame Barnikel</h3>

<p>Amy's mother strongly disapproves of Carpenter, finding him dull, unattractive, and potentially unstable. She tells Amy bluntly that "the poor fellow's moonstruck. He's not right in the head." Dame Barnikel prefers the cheerful Ducket and actively encourages Amy to pursue him instead. She only tolerates Carpenter's courtship out of respect for her husband John Fleming's opinion.</p>

<p>After the Peasants' Revolt, Dame Barnikel ceases to like John Wyclif and by extension disapproves even more of Carpenter's Lollard sympathies. She refuses to allow him to bring his Lollard Bible to the George. Despite her disapproval, she ultimately accepts the marriage, though one suspects with considerable reluctance.</p>

<h3 id='john-fleming'>John Fleming</h3>

<p>Amy's father takes a liking to Carpenter, which is the main reason Dame Barnikel doesn't send him packing. Fleming's approval suggests he sees something worthy in the young craftsman's character—perhaps recognizing a fellow serious-minded man. However, after Fleming's death, his final note to Amy strongly endorses Ducket rather than Carpenter, possibly indicating that Fleming's opinion had evolved, or that he simply recognized Ducket's exceptional qualities without necessarily rejecting Carpenter.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Ben Carpenter lives during a pivotal moment in English history, characterized by religious ferment and social upheaval. The teachings of John Wyclif challenge the authority and corruption of the medieval Church, advocating for direct access to scripture and questioning the entire hierarchical system. The translation of the Bible into English represents a revolutionary democratization of religious knowledge, threatening the Church's monopoly on interpreting God's word.</p>

<p>The Peasants' Revolt of 1381, sparked by the oppressive poll tax, represents one of the most dramatic popular uprisings in English history. The revolt expresses both economic grievances and deeper questions about social hierarchy and the nature of authority. John Ball's famous sermon—with its questions about why some are born to privilege while others labor in poverty—articulates ideas that will resonate through centuries of social struggle.</p>

<p>Carpenter embodies the artisan class caught between traditional hierarchies and new ideas about religious and social equality. As a craftsman, he has enough education to read, enough independence to think for himself, yet not enough power or worldly wisdom to navigate safely the dangerous currents of his time. His sincere belief in the righteousness of the peasant cause and his attraction to Lollard theology make him representative of a strand of English radicalism that combines religious reform with social protest.</p>

<p>The aftermath of the revolt sees brutal repression of the rebels and increasing persecution of Lollards. Carpenter's possession of a Lollard Bible in 1382 places him in real danger, as the authorities crack down on Wyclif's followers. That he continues to hold these texts and beliefs despite the risks demonstrates both his courage and his potentially dangerous inflexibility.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Ben Carpenter represents the tension between sincere religious conviction and social stability. His character raises questions about the relationship between faith, reason, and action. Is Carpenter a man of genuine spiritual insight who sees beyond the corruption of his age, or is he, as Dame Barnikel suggests, "moonstruck" and unstable? The novel leaves this question partially unresolved, presenting him sympathetically while also showing how his convictions lead him into genuine danger.</p>

<p>His involvement in the Peasants' Revolt illustrates the theme of idealism versus reality. Carpenter genuinely believes the rebels are loyal subjects seeking justice, trusting in the righteousness of their cause even when evidence suggests otherwise. His dream-like walk into the burning Savoy Palace suggests a man whose convictions can override his survival instincts—a quality that can be read as either admirable commitment or dangerous fanaticism.</p>

<p>The contrast between Carpenter and Ducket embodies different approaches to life in uncertain times. Carpenter is serious, brooding, ideologically committed; Ducket is adaptable, pragmatic, cheerful. When crisis comes, it is the pragmatic Ducket who saves the idealistic Carpenter's life. This suggests a subtle authorial judgment about the relative merits of different temperaments, though the novel avoids simple moralism.</p>

<p>Carpenter's pursuit of the Lollard Bible represents the theme of knowledge and its consequences. His ability to read gives him access to ideas that both enlighten and endanger him. The novel suggests that literacy and independent thought, while valuable, carry risks—especially for those without the social power or worldly wisdom to protect themselves from the consequences of their convictions.</p>

<p>Finally, Carpenter's marriage to Amy represents a kind of settling, a choice made not from passion but from habit, obligation, and the foreclosure of other options. His story is ultimately one of a decent but limited man whose earnest engagement with the great questions of his time fails to translate into either personal happiness or meaningful social change.</p>
