<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Colonel Meredith is a distinguished British Army officer and scholar who represents the cultivated, intellectual side of the Victorian military establishment. A man of exceptional education and worldly experience, he spent thirty years traveling throughout India, China, and Arabia, becoming fluent in seven languages and immersing himself in the cultures of the East. At once a dangerous soldier and a cultivated gentleman, he combines the roles of tiger hunter and Persian poetry translator, embodying the paradoxes of Britain's imperial age. His late-life marriage to <a href="characters/Violet-Bull-1889.html">Violet Bull</a>, daughter of the wealthy brewer Edward Bull, became one of the most controversial relationships in the family, particularly due to their significant age difference and the romantic triangle it created.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>As a young man in 1851, Meredith is described as handsome with a good height, auburn hair, and an athletic figure. By 1889, at nearly sixty years old, he has aged devastatingly well: his hair, clipped rather short, is still auburn with greying temples that only improve his appearance. The lines around his eyes suggest a man who has seen much of the world in all kinds of weather. His body is lean and hard, and he wears a long silky moustache. There is "a hint that when the circumstances demanded it he could be dangerous," yet also "a gentleness and an intelligence that suggested he was more than a military man."</p>

<p>In his private life, he favors Oriental comfort, wearing a magnificent red dressing-gown of Oriental silk brocade, a red fez, white silk socks, and moccasins with curling toes while relaxing at home.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Meredith possesses an unusual combination of qualities that set him apart from the typical Victorian gentleman. He is cultivated and intellectual, with a genuine curiosity about other cultures that goes far beyond the typical imperial administrator. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he seeks to understand rather than simply dominate, showing a scholarly interest in Hindu religion, Persian poetry, and Arabic culture that was rare for his time.</p>

<p>His manner is quiet, polite, and refined, with eyes that "had a delightful way of lighting up as he spoke of the things that interested him." He displays a natural courtesy and breeding that makes him stand out even among the wealthy families he encounters. When challenged or insulted, he responds with dignity rather than anger, secure enough in himself not to need to argue with those beneath his station.</p>

<p>Despite his gentle demeanor, he is unmistakably a man of action and danger. His military career and hunting exploits reveal physical courage and capability. The text notes that his "exploits, though he did no more than hint at them, were legendary to his inner circle," and his "amorous conquests" were equally legendary, though he maintained strict honor regarding the wives of brother officers.</p>

<p>Meredith's independence of spirit is evident in his original plan as a youth to study Hindu religion by living among the priests—an idea that shocked his dinner companions in 1851 but which foreshadowed his lifelong pattern of crossing cultural boundaries. He cares little for the opinions of the commercially-minded families he encounters, recognizing his own intellectual and social superiority without arrogance.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1851-young-traveler-at-the-guvnors-dinner'>1851: Young Traveler at the Guv'nor's Dinner</h3>

<p>At around twenty-one years old, having recently left Eton, Meredith is introduced to London society as he prepares for a year of travel before joining a regiment. His father, a banker in partnership with the Penny family, has arranged for him to travel to India with Captain Jonas Barnikel. At their first meeting, Barnikel sizes up the young gentleman, noting his good looks and athletic figure, but wondering "what was he really made of?"</p>

<p>At the Guv'nor's (Silas Dogget's) birthday dinner party at Blackheath, Meredith is seated beside <a href="characters/Mary-Anne-Dogget-1827.html">Mary Anne Dogget</a> (later Bull), who is acting as hostess. Their conversation reveals his cultured sensibilities—he admits to liking poetry and being fascinated by history, interests that immediately appeal to Mary Anne. When questioned about his plans for India, he explains his unconventional desire to study Hindu religion and gods by seeking instruction from priests in temples, perhaps even living amongst them. This announcement appalls the assembled company.</p>

<p>The merchant-class family dismisses his intellectual interests. Arnold Silversleeves suggests he should study railways instead. The Guv'nor calls the Hindus "savages" and declares it a "bad idea." Edward Bull laughs and patronizingly dismisses the plan as a waste of time and money. Only Mary Anne defends him, finding his curiosity "most commendable" and "fascinating," recognizing that he is "much better bred and far more intelligent than they were."</p>

<p>The encounter creates an immediate attraction between Meredith and Mary Anne, evident in their animated conversation about Hindu gods, maharajas, and exotic adventures. Mary Anne's remark, "I wish... that I could come with you," reveals her romantic interest, which her husband Edward notices and resents. As they part, Mary Anne squeezes Meredith's hand in a brief, charged moment that suggests what might have been. Edward Bull ensures they never meet again.</p>

<h3 id='1851-1889-years-abroad'>1851-1889: Years Abroad</h3>

<p>Meredith spends the next thirty years traveling extensively throughout the British Empire. His time takes him to India, China, and Arabia, where he becomes not just a military officer but a scholar-soldier in the tradition of the best of Britain's imperial administrators. He becomes fluent in seven languages plus several dialects, learns to read Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic, and develops a profound knowledge of Eastern cultures.</p>

<p>During this period, he serves with distinction in the Indian Army, where his exploits become legendary. He saves the life of a Sikh who becomes his devoted servant. He hunts tigers extensively—by the time of his death, Edward Bull will claim he "had probably shot more tigers than any other man in the British Empire." His amorous conquests are equally legendary, though he maintains strict boundaries with the wives of fellow officers.</p>

<p>He never marries during these years, partly because, as he claims, he never finds time, but perhaps also because no woman quite matches the memory of that evening with Mary Anne Bull.</p>

<h3 id='1889-return-to-england'>1889: Return to England</h3>

<p>By late 1889, now nearly sixty years old, Colonel Meredith has returned to England permanently. He has settled in a striking castle-like house in Melbury Road, Holland Park, which he has filled with the collections from his travels. The house features ivory tusks over the fireplace, Chinese lacquer boxes, a wooden Buddha, Indian daggers, Persian miniatures, and a magnificent tiger skin on the floor. His Sikh servant, magnificently turbaned, serves him faithfully.</p>

<p>A book of his own is about to be published: <em>Love Poems, translated from the Persian</em>. The staff at Hatchards bookshop on Piccadilly know him as a distinguished customer.</p>

<h3 id='december-1889-reunion-with-mary-anne'>December 1889: Reunion with Mary Anne</h3>

<p>One winter afternoon at Hatchards, Meredith encounters Mary Anne Bull again after thirty-eight years. Now sixty-two, Mary Anne is shopping with her daughter <a href="characters/Violet-Bull-1889.html">Violet</a>. The recognition is mutual and electric. Mary Anne's reaction is visceral: "How could a man of her own age look so devastatingly handsome?" She blushes uncontrollably and babbles incoherently about tigers.</p>

<p>Meredith invites them to tea at his house the following Wednesday. At the tea, he reveals something of his fascinating life to both Mary Anne and Violet. For Mary Anne, "the effect was simple, unexpected, and searing." By the end of the visit, "she knew only that she wanted to leave her house, her difficult daughter and her husband and to come to rest, for as long as he would have her, in Meredith's arms."</p>

<p>At Violet's provocative request, Meredith appears in his "natural state"—wearing his magnificent red silk brocade dressing-gown, red fez, and moccasins, smoking his long Indian pipe. The image devastates Mary Anne. As they leave, he presses her hand discreetly and says softly, "I hope we may meet again."</p>

<h3 id='winter-1889-1890-courtship-of-violet'>Winter 1889-1890: Courtship of Violet</h3>

<p>What happens next shocks everyone: instead of pursuing Mary Anne, Meredith begins courting her daughter Violet. Mary Anne does not attend his poetry reading at Hatchards in early 1890, but Violet does. From that point on, Violet sees him at least two days a week, ostensibly attending lectures, concerts, and galleries together.</p>

<p>Meredith's interest in Violet seems to be based on her intelligence and spirit. When Mary Anne asks his opinion about Violet wanting to attend university, he responds thoughtfully, suggesting that university itself won't provide wider horizons but that "it's really a matter of the spirit. Destiny, I expect." He recognizes in Violet a kindred independent spirit, someone who, like him, refuses to be constrained by conventional society.</p>

<h3 id='april-1890-the-announcement'>April 1890: The Announcement</h3>

<p>In early April 1890, Violet announces to her mother that she is going to marry Colonel Meredith. The news devastates Mary Anne for multiple reasons: her own suppressed feelings for him, the age difference, and the behind-the-back courtship. When Mary Anne protests about his age and suggests university would be better, Violet replies coldly, "He is the most educated and the most interesting man I shall ever meet in my life."</p>

<p>The following day, Meredith visits Edward Bull to formally ask for Violet's hand. Bull, though likely sensing something of the complex emotions involved, accepts the marriage. As Violet predicted, her father is "quite glad to have me off his hands," and a wealthy, distinguished gentleman like Meredith is an excellent match despite the age difference.</p>

<p>Violet's final words to her mother are devastating: "I shouldn't tell you if it were so... But after all, mother, one thing is certain anyway. <em>You</em> can't have him."</p>

<h3 id='1890-c1887-marriage-and-family'>1890-c.1887: Marriage and Family</h3>

<p>Meredith and Violet marry in 1890. The marriage appears to be genuinely happy and passionate. Despite Meredith being about sixty years old at the time of his marriage, he fathers three children: <a href="characters/Henry-Meredith-1894.html">Henry</a> (born 1894), Frederick (born c. 1900), and <a href="characters/Helen-Meredith-1903.html">Helen</a> (born 1903). Violet later describes them as "passionately in love."</p>

<p>The union of this cultivated, worldly officer with the spirited, intellectual Violet seems well-matched. Meredith provides Violet with the wider horizons and educated companionship she craved, while Violet offers him, in his later years, a passionate and worthy partner.</p>

<h3 id='c-1887-death'>c. 1887: Death</h3>

<p>Meredith dies suddenly of a massive heart attack around 1887, when he is approximately seventy. Violet describes him as remaining "so strong and slim" that she had supposed he would live to a great age, making his death a surprise. In his final moments, though unable to speak for half a day, he gives Violet "a tender look, a squeeze of her hand, and he was gone."</p>

<p>His death leaves Violet with less money than she expected, though they are not exactly poor. Edward Bull steps in to pay for the children's schools. The memory of Meredith continues to shape the family, particularly through his reputation as a great sportsman and tiger hunter, which Edward Bull uses to protect young Henry from bullying at Charterhouse.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='mary-anne-bull'>Mary Anne Bull</h3>

<p>The relationship between Meredith and Mary Anne is one of the great unfulfilled romances in the story, marked by a single charged evening in 1851 and a brief, devastating reunion in 1889.</p>

<p>At their first meeting, Mary Anne is immediately attracted to this refined young man who is so superior to the commercial families around her. During dinner, she recognizes that "he couldn't care less what Edward thinks, or any of the rest of us... He's absolutely right. We're all... so vulgar." Even her "good and kindly husband, with his hard blue eyes, his broad, fair face and manly ways" is "made of coarse cloth compared to this young man."</p>

<p>Their conversation about Hindu gods and exotic adventures reveals a meeting of minds that Mary Anne has never experienced with her husband. Her whispered wish, "I wish... that I could come with you," and the squeeze of his hand as they part suggest the beginning of something that circumstances will prevent. Edward Bull, recognizing the threat, ensures they never meet again.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight years later, the attraction remains unchanged. At their reunion at Hatchards, Mary Anne is overwhelmed by physical and emotional desire. The tea at his house brings her to the point where she "wanted to leave her house, her difficult daughter and her husband and to come to rest, for as long as he would have her, in Meredith's arms." The sight of him in his Oriental dressing-gown, smoking his pipe, represents everything exotic and passionate that her life has lacked.</p>

<p>The cruel irony is that instead of requiting her feelings, Meredith pursues and marries her daughter. Whether this is because Mary Anne is already married and he will not break that code, because Violet actively pursues him and Mary Anne does not, or because he genuinely finds the younger woman more compatible, the text does not explicitly state. The situation creates a permanent wound in the mother-daughter relationship.</p>

<h3 id='violet-bullmeredith'>Violet Bull/Meredith</h3>

<p>Meredith's relationship with Violet is based on intellectual compatibility and mutual recognition of independent spirits. When they first meet at the tea in December 1889, Violet is sulky and difficult, but she becomes fascinated by his library of books in multiple languages. His ability to read Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic, and his knowledge of seven languages, impresses her deeply.</p>

<p>Meredith handles Violet's rudeness and provocative behavior with patience and understanding. When she bluntly states that her parents' world is "ludicrous," he calmly disagrees but acknowledges her desire for "wider horizons." He recognizes in her the same spirit of rebellion and intellectual curiosity that has shaped his own life.</p>

<p>Their courtship, conducted largely in secret, consists of lectures, galleries, and concerts—the life of the mind that Violet craves. The significant age difference—he is about sixty, she is twenty-one—does not seem to trouble either of them. Violet's declaration that he is "the most educated and the most interesting man I shall ever meet in my life" suggests she values his mind and experience over youth.</p>

<p>Their marriage is described as passionate, with Meredith remaining virile enough to father three children, the last when he is approximately seventy-three years old. Violet's later statement to her son Henry that "Your father was very much in favour of votes for women" suggests they shared progressive political views as well.</p>

<p>Meredith's death leaves Violet with not only financial strain but also the burden of defending his memory and raising their children alone. The fact that she keeps his name and continues to invoke his authority suggests the depth of her respect and love for him.</p>

<h3 id='edward-bull'>Edward Bull</h3>

<p>Meredith's relationship with Edward Bull begins with tension at the Guv'nor's dinner party in 1851. Bull, representing practical commercial values, dismisses Meredith's intellectual interests as "all nonsense" and patronizingly lectures him about free trade and the cost of maintaining the army. The exchange includes a thinly veiled insult about Meredith expecting taxpayers like Bull to fund his military career.</p>

<p>Bull's irritation is partly professional disagreement—he cannot understand why anyone would want to study Hindu gods rather than railways—but also personal jealousy. He clearly sees the attraction between Meredith and his wife Mary Anne, particularly evident in their animated conversation and Mary Anne's defense of the young man. Bull's response is to mock Meredith publicly and ensure his wife never sees him again.</p>

<p>Decades later, when Meredith returns to court Violet, Bull's reaction is more measured. By this time, Bull has become a wealthy country squire and Meredith a distinguished colonel and gentleman. Despite the age difference and the complex family dynamics, Bull accepts the match. Whether this is because Meredith's social status and wealth make him acceptable, because Bull is glad to have the difficult Violet married off, or because he never realizes the connection to Mary Anne's earlier feelings, the text does not make clear.</p>

<p>After Meredith's death, Bull uses the colonel's reputation as "the most remarkable sportsman" and the greatest tiger hunter in the empire to protect Meredith's son Henry from bullying at Charterhouse, suggesting a posthumous respect for the man.</p>

<h3 id='the-guvnor-and-his-family'>The Guv'nor and His Family</h3>

<p>At the 1851 dinner, Meredith encounters the rising merchant class personified by Silas Dogget (the Guv'nor) and his family. Their response to his plans reveals the gulf between old aristocratic culture and new commercial wealth. The Guv'nor dismisses Hindus as "savages," while the sons-in-law variously try to redirect Meredith toward more "practical" pursuits like studying railways or German industry.</p>

<p>Only Mary Anne, the youngest daughter, understands and appreciates Meredith's intellectual curiosity. The encounter reveals Meredith's social confidence—he does not argue or become defensive, simply bowing his head "out of politeness" because "he did not want to argue with them; he was a guest in their house." His breeding and self-assurance make the family's dismissal of his interests seem provincial and narrow.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Colonel Meredith represents a particular type of Victorian officer: the scholar-soldier who combined military service with genuine intellectual and cultural engagement. While the East India Company and later the British Raj employed many competent administrators, men like Meredith who learned multiple languages, studied indigenous religions and literature, and genuinely sought to understand the cultures they encountered were rare and valued.</p>

<p>His career spans the period from the 1850s through the 1880s, encompassing the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the gradual transition from East India Company rule to direct Crown rule, and the expansion of British control throughout the subcontinent. The text notes that "the Indian Civil Service was of the finest quality. Its highly educated élite had a profound knowledge of the subcontinent. In the army, officers were often proficient in local languages and scholar soldiers like Colonel Meredith were not unknown."</p>

<p>Meredith's interest in Hindu religion, Sanskrit literature, and Persian poetry reflects the genuine renaissance in Oriental studies that occurred in the nineteenth century. The text mentions that "a recent renaissance of the study of Indian culture in the subcontinent itself had actually been led by English scholars rather than Indian," and that "some of the administrators of the East India Company were deeply knowledgeable."</p>

<p>His translations of Persian love poetry and his collection of Oriental artifacts represent the Victorian fascination with the exotic, though in Meredith's case it goes beyond mere collecting to genuine scholarship and cultural appreciation. His ability to live comfortably in both worlds—wearing a fez and dressing-gown at home while maintaining his position in London society—suggests a cosmopolitanism rare for his time.</p>

<p>The age difference in his marriage to Violet, while shocking, was not without precedent in Victorian society, particularly for distinguished older men marrying younger women. What makes it notable in this case is the intellectual rather than purely financial basis of the match, and the complex emotional triangle it creates within the family.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Meredith embodies several key themes in the novel:</p>

<p><strong>The Clash Between Commercial and Cultural Values</strong>: His first appearance at the Guv'nor's dinner crystallizes the difference between the rising merchant class, focused on railways, trade, and practical results, and the older aristocratic tradition of cultivation and learning. While the merchants measure everything by its commercial utility, Meredith pursues knowledge for its own sake.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Border-Crossing</strong>: In an age of empire, Meredith represents the rare individual who genuinely crosses cultural boundaries rather than simply imposing British values. His fluency in seven languages, his study of Hindu and Persian literature, and his willingness to live among the peoples he encounters suggest a more enlightened approach to empire than the crude commercial exploitation represented by characters like Bull.</p>

<p><strong>The Road Not Taken</strong>: Meredith's relationship with Mary Anne represents one of the great "what ifs" in the story. Their single evening together in 1851 suggests a possible life of passion and intellectual companionship that circumstances prevent. The reunion in 1889 makes the loss even more poignant, as Mary Anne realizes what she has missed by marrying the conventional Edward Bull instead.</p>

<p><strong>The Complexity of Desire</strong>: The triangle between Meredith, Mary Anne, and Violet reveals how desire can span generations and create unexpected configurations. That the daughter wins the man the mother wanted creates a permanent wound, while also suggesting that Violet may have unconsciously known and seized what her mother desired.</p>

<p><strong>Age and Vitality</strong>: Meredith's continued vigor and attractiveness into his sixties and seventies challenges Victorian assumptions about aging and masculinity. His ability to father children in his seventies and his continued physical and intellectual vitality suggest that experience and cultivation can be more attractive than youth.</p>

<p><strong>The Scholar as Hero</strong>: In a culture that celebrated military valor and commercial success, Meredith represents a different kind of heroism: the life of the mind combined with physical courage. His tiger hunting and military exploits satisfy conventional masculine ideals, while his poetry translations and cultural studies represent a more refined achievement.</p>
