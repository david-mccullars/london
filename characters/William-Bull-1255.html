<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>William Bull is a wealthy patrician merchant of London, representing the declining fortunes of the old merchant aristocracy in the face of King Edward I's reforms. In his late thirties or early forties in 1295, he is a man at a crossroads: publicly humiliated when passed over for alderman in favor of his hated rival <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a>, and trapped in a miserable marriage. His crucial decision to abandon London for his country estate at Bocton marks the retreat of his family from the city they had dominated for generations. Despite his bitterness and personal struggles, William demonstrates unexpected nobility when he intervenes to save the life of <a href="characters/Martin-Fleming-1277.html">Martin Fleming</a>, displaying a moral courage that transcends his social prejudices.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>William Bull is described as a large, burly man in his late thirties or early forties with thick calves, a florid face with a blotchy cheek and heavy jowl. He wears a cloak, hide boots folded over below the knee, and presents as someone obviously used to being obeyed. His physical presence is imposing and commanding, befitting his patrician status.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>William Bull is a complex figure torn between his patrician pride and a fundamental sense of decency. He is proud of his family history and deeply conscious of his status as a descendant of barons and aldermen who ruled London for generations. This pride has been severely wounded by the social and political changes of his time, leaving him bitter and resentful toward both the Crown and the rising merchant class.</p>

<p>He possesses a cruel streak, as evidenced by his tormenting of his impoverished cousin Elias with the promise of future inheritance while knowing he plans to leave London entirely. He also contemplates visiting a brothel partly to escape his unhappy marriage, showing a capacity for moral compromise. Yet beneath this hardened exterior lies a man of honor who keeps his word even at personal cost.</p>

<p>His most admirable quality emerges when he helps the young woman <a href="characters/Joan-Fleming-1280.html">Joan</a> in her desperate scheme to save her condemned lover. Once he gives his word, he pursues the cause relentlessly, even humbling himself before his hated enemy Barnikel to secure a royal pardon. This suggests that William's better nature can overcome his prejudices when confronted with genuine injustice.</p>

<p>William is trapped in a deeply unhappy marriage to a woman described as "grey, gaunt, insistent" who "complained if he was out and harassed him if he was home." This domestic misery has driven him to occasional visits to the Bankside brothels, which he views as "a little quiet solace."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='family-background-and-decline'>Family Background and Decline</h3>

<p>William Bull was born into one of London's great patrician families. His father was a baron and alderman who had installed a luxurious privy in their house "by the sign of the Bull," upon which he sat "as though upon a throne, a merchant monarch proud of all he did." The family had owned substantial property in the parish of St Mary-le-Bow and held aldermanries as their natural right.</p>

<p>However, the long reign of King Henry III (1216-1272) brought difficulties. The rebellion led by Simon de Montfort saw solid citizens rise up against rich dynasts like the Bulls. A party led by the young fishmonger Barnikel even smashed the door of the Bull house and tried to set fire to it. Worse still, William's father's own brother joined these rebels, becoming a traitor who was cut off from the family forever. This betrayal left a lasting wound on the family's pride.</p>

<h3 id='the-reign-of-edward-i'>The Reign of Edward I</h3>

<p>Under King Edward I (1272-1307), the situation became dire. The king, determined to break the power of London's patrician oligarchy, dismissed the mayor and installed his own warden. Through a series of reforms ostensibly improving law and order, Edward systematically undermined patrician privileges. Foreign merchants were given equal trading rights, and the king's Exchequer court moved into the Guildhall, displacing the aldermen's traditional Husting court.</p>

<p>When the aldermen protested about London's ancient privileges, the warden threw them out and replaced them with "new men, chosen by the Exchequer" – including "fishmongers, skinners, smelly little craftsmen." The Montfort rebels were back in power, this time with royal backing.</p>

<p>The family's commercial position declined as well. While William's father had made huge profitable sales to the royal Wardrobe, William "could not sell them a thing." The best wine trade went to men from Bordeaux, the biggest wool dealers were Italians or men from the West Country. "We've been sidestepped," William concluded bitterly. "That leopard's run round us."</p>

<h3 id='november-1295-the-crisis-point'>November 1295: The Crisis Point</h3>

<p>On the morning of the key events, William sat in his luxurious privy contemplating two decisions – one small, one large. The large decision came easily after the humiliation of the previous day: the Bulls would leave London for good, retiring to their estate at Bocton.</p>

<p>The day before, William had presented himself at the Guildhall to be chosen as alderman for his ward. He had been assiduous in courting support, swallowing his pride to make himself agreeable even to lesser merchants and craftsmen. No one had challenged him, and he approached the day "discreetly, happily, his sense of family history lending him a dignity of which he was rather proud."</p>

<p>But an Exchequer man waved him away curtly: "We don't want you. We've chosen someone else... Barnikel." The cursed fishmonger from Billingsgate was to be alderman of the Bulls' own ward. It was the final, unbearable humiliation. "It was too much to bear," William decided, and resolved to sell his house to a taverner and retire permanently to the country.</p>

<h3 id='the-small-decision'>The Small Decision</h3>

<p>The smaller decision concerned whether to visit a virgin being offered at the Dog's Head brothel on Bankside. He hesitated partly from guilt about his wife, but after she harassed him and he threatened her with a scold's bridle (for which he immediately felt ashamed), he decided to go.</p>

<h3 id='the-meeting-with-joan'>The Meeting with Joan</h3>

<p>At the Dog's Head, William was assured he was "the very first to get there" – the brothelkeeper having reserved the virgin Joan for his most important customers. Joan, a fifteen-year-old girl, initially protested but was forced to comply by the brothelkeeper's threats.</p>

<p>However, when alone with William in her attic room, Joan took a desperate gamble. She told him everything: that she was indeed a virgin, that her betrothed Martin Fleming had been unjustly condemned to hang, and that she had become a registered prostitute for one day in order to claim him before the justices (an ancient legal custom that allowed a condemned man to go free if a prostitute would marry him). She needed William to help maintain the fiction that she had actually served as a prostitute, while in reality preserving her virginity.</p>

<p>William was astonished: "That she would even dare to do such a thing! 'My God,' he said, after agreeing to help, 'your young man's a lucky fellow.'" He agreed to help her, though he preferred to tell the justices privately that he had had her if it came to that, to spare his own embarrassment regarding his wife. He also promised to tell Martin the truth afterward so the young man wouldn't have doubts.</p>

<h3 id='sweet-revenge'>Sweet Revenge</h3>

<p>When William and Joan emerged from the brothel, they encountered the newly-made Alderman Barnikel, who had also come for the virgin. Barnikel was furious to discover that William had gotten there first. For William, this coincidence was "so extraordinary... so sweet the revenge on Barnikel, that Bull found as he returned across the bridge that he felt quite as contented as if he had had a dozen virgins." He even thought he "might even go to bed with my wife, so happy was his mood."</p>

<h3 id='the-hanging-at-newgate'>The Hanging at Newgate</h3>

<p>The next morning, William went to Newgate to witness Joan's attempt to claim Martin Fleming. He observed the crowd, spotting Martin's concave-faced family and Joan's solemn craftsmen relatives. When Joan appeared in the striped white dress of a prostitute carrying penitential candles, the scene became chaotic.</p>

<p>Joan's father protested that his daughter was respectable and still a virgin, but Joan maintained she could prove she was a prostitute registered at the Dog's Head. The Lombard moneylender (Martin's accuser) furiously objected that the whole thing was play-acting. At this moment, <a href="characters/Dionysius-Silversleeves-1266.html">Dionysius Silversleeves</a> burst forward and publicly announced: "She is a whore. I had her last night. And so did he!" – pointing at William.</p>

<p>William "was not very pleased at being publicly exposed by young Silversleeves, though he did not blame the girl for that." But the real disaster came when Martin Fleming, seeing Joan's guilty and confused expression and believing she truly was a whore, refused to marry her: "No, sir. I don't want her."</p>

<h3 id='the-quest-for-pardon'>The Quest for Pardon</h3>

<p>William felt bound by his word to help Joan. "I said I'd help her," he muttered, and immediately rode to Westminster Palace where Parliament was gathering, seeking a pardon from the Warden of London.</p>

<p>He found the warden talking with King Edward himself and boldly interrupted to plead his case. The king was intrigued that this solid patrician would pay for a pardon for a poor man unrelated to him. But when the warden mentioned the victim was a Lombard moneylender, Edward's eyes glowered at William: "I will not have my foreign merchants bothered. No pardon."</p>

<p>The warden told the king afterward: "He's one of the patricians you wanted to break. A wise decision."</p>

<h3 id='the-ultimate-humiliation'>The Ultimate Humiliation</h3>

<p>Dejected, William rode slowly back toward London. Near the palace of Savoy, he encountered a group of aldermen heading to Parliament – including Barnikel. A sudden realization struck him: Barnikel, who had just seen the king personally, could probably "get anything he wanted."</p>

<p>This was William's moment of moral crisis. Asking Barnikel for help would be devastating to his pride, but "a life's a life," he told himself. He rode "humbly" to the fishmonger and begged for his help.</p>

<p>Barnikel understood "what it had cost the patrician to come begging to him like that." He went to the king, who was amused that a second person would plead for this same condemned man. The king granted the pardon, but reminded Barnikel: "The favours even of kings usually come at a price... I shall be relying on you" – a clear reference to the upcoming Parliament vote on taxes.</p>

<h3 id='the-rescue'>The Rescue</h3>

<p>"A quarter of an hour later," Martin Fleming stood under the elm tree at Smithfield with the noose already around his neck when he saw "William Bull, Alderman Barnikel, and a royal clerk, riding swiftly towards them with a cry: 'Royal pardon.'"</p>

<h3 id='the-wedding'>The Wedding</h3>

<p>A few days later, William Bull "gave the bride away" at the wedding of Martin and Joan Fleming in the porch of St Mary Overy church in Southwark. Alderman Barnikel stood by Martin, and the two <a href="characters/Isobel-Dogget-1270.html">Dogget sisters</a> acted as bridesmaids. Neither Martin's nor Joan's family attended, as they had not gotten over the scandal.</p>

<p>The priest thought "he had never seen anything like it in his life."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='elias-bull'>Elias Bull</h3>

<p><a href="characters/Elias-Bull-1265.html">Elias Bull</a> is William's cousin, the son of William's father's brother who had betrayed the family by joining the Montfort rebellion. Elias is a poor weaver who occasionally comes begging for help. William treats him with contempt and cruelty, giving him only three marks and mockingly suggesting he return in a year for a possible inheritance – knowing full well that William will have left London by then. This treatment reflects William's deep bitterness about his family's decline and his inability to forgive the betrayal of his uncle.</p>

<h3 id='his-wife'>His Wife</h3>

<p>William's marriage is profoundly unhappy. His wife is described as "grey, gaunt, insistent" and someone who "complained if he was out and harassed him if he was home." They have three children together, which William sees as her primary contribution to the marriage, reminding himself daily that "she had given him three strong children." Over twenty years, "he had tried to love her" but "in the last few years, he had quietly given up."</p>

<p>The relationship is characterized by constant conflict. She harasses him even when he's in the privy, and he threatens her (though shamefully) with a scold's bridle. When he announces they're moving to the country estate at Bocton, she protests "I hate the country" and declares "I shall stay here in London." He cheerfully tells her he's selling the house to a taverner. Her cries of "You beast... You brute!" and accusations that he's going "after some woman" reveal a relationship of mutual resentment and misery.</p>

<h3 id='waldus-barnikel'>Waldus Barnikel</h3>

<p><a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a> is William's nemesis, representing everything he despises about the social changes destroying his world. Barnikel's grandfather had led the attack on the Bull house during the Montfort rebellion. Now Barnikel, a "new-made alderman" and "that cursed, low-born fishmonger," has been appointed alderman of William's own ward, the ultimate humiliation.</p>

<p>At the Dog's Head brothel, William takes pleasure in arriving first and depriving Barnikel of the virgin. He enjoys watching Barnikel's fury: "Seems I got in first," he says bluntly, savoring the fishmonger's rage. The encounter is "so extraordinary... so sweet the revenge on Barnikel" that William leaves "quite as contented as if he had had a dozen virgins."</p>

<p>Yet later, when Martin Fleming's life hangs in the balance, William overcomes his pride and hatred. Going "humbly" to Barnikel to beg for help is perhaps the most difficult thing William does in the entire story, and it reveals the depth of his moral character that he can set aside his bitterness to save an innocent life.</p>

<h3 id='joan-and-martin-fleming'>Joan and Martin Fleming</h3>

<p>William's relationship with <a href="characters/Joan-Fleming-1280.html">Joan</a> and <a href="characters/Martin-Fleming-1277.html">Martin Fleming</a> begins as a transactional encounter at a brothel but transforms into something far more significant. When Joan reveals her desperate plan, William is moved by her courage and agrees to help: "That's the bravest thing I ever heard of in my life."</p>

<p>He keeps his word even when circumstances become complicated. When publicly exposed by Silversleeves, he doesn't blame Joan. When Martin refuses to marry Joan and the hanging proceeds, William doesn't give up. He pursues every avenue, even humbling himself before Barnikel, to secure the pardon.</p>

<p>His commitment to this young couple – people far beneath his social station with whom he has no blood connection – reveals a fundamental decency beneath his patrician pride. At their wedding, he gives the bride away, having become a kind of surrogate father figure to the friendless couple whom both their families have abandoned.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>William Bull embodies the twilight of London's patrician merchant oligarchy. For generations, families like the Bulls had ruled the city as a virtually hereditary aristocracy. They were the aldermen and mayors, the barons whose wealth and power rivaled that of landed nobility. They controlled trade, owned vast properties, and intermarried among themselves to consolidate power.</p>

<p>King Edward I's systematic dismantling of this oligarchy was part of his broader program to strengthen royal authority throughout England. By giving foreign merchants equal rights, Edward undermined the patricians' commercial monopolies. By installing his own warden and packing the aldermanic courts with men from the rising merchant class, he broke their political power. By favoring Italian bankers and provincial wool merchants for royal contracts, he cut off their access to Crown patronage.</p>

<p>The "maltote" (the severe wool customs tax Edward imposed to fund his Scottish campaign) that William mentions was part of Edward's general policy of using parliamentary taxation to fund his wars while simultaneously using Parliament to check the power of both barons and urban oligarchs. When Barnikel attends the Model Parliament of 1295 and votes for generous taxation, he represents the new merchant class that Edward deliberately cultivated to replace the old guard.</p>

<p>William's decision to retreat to his country estate at Bocton reflects a broader pattern. Many patrician families, finding themselves outcompeted in the city, retired to become country gentry. This was easier for families like the Bulls who had already acquired substantial rural estates through generations of wealth accumulation.</p>

<p>The location of William's house "by the sign of the Bull" in what was once the aristocratic parish of St Mary-le-Bow but has now been reassigned to "the mean little church" of St Lawrence Silversleeves perfectly symbolizes the family's declining fortunes. Even the geography of the city is being reorganized in ways that diminish patrician prestige.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<h3 id='the-decline-of-patrician-london'>The Decline of Patrician London</h3>

<p>William Bull personifies the displacement of London's old merchant aristocracy. His family's story spans generations of dominance followed by steady erosion of power, wealth, and prestige. The humiliation of being passed over for alderman in favor of Barnikel – whose grandfather attacked the Bull house – represents the complete inversion of the old social order. William's decision to abandon London marks a watershed: the Bulls, who helped build and rule the city for centuries, are leaving.</p>

<h3 id='honor-vs-pride'>Honor vs. Pride</h3>

<p>William's character arc explores the tension between prideful resentment and honorable action. He is bitter, cruel to his cousin, contemplates adultery, and takes petty pleasure in minor victories over Barnikel. Yet when confronted with Joan's desperation and Martin's unjust condemnation, his sense of honor proves stronger than his pride. His willingness to humble himself before Barnikel – arguably the most difficult thing he does – demonstrates that keeping one's word matters more than preserving one's dignity.</p>

<h3 id='class-and-social-change'>Class and Social Change</h3>

<p>The story uses William to examine how rapid social change affects individuals. He understands intellectually that immigrants and rising craftsmen are "mixing and marrying" and transforming London into a more dynamic, diverse city. He can even acknowledge grudgingly that Edward's reforms may have been needed because patrician rule "may have been a bit slack." But emotionally, he experiences this transformation as personal humiliation and loss. His inability to adapt – his decision to flee rather than compete – raises questions about whether traditional elites can or should survive such changes.</p>

<h3 id='justice-and-mercy'>Justice and Mercy</h3>

<p>William's intervention to save Martin Fleming explores the relationship between formal justice and moral justice. The legal system has condemned Martin for a crime he didn't commit (and which William recognizes as "foul play"). Joan's desperate scheme exploits an archaic legal custom to subvert this miscarriage of justice. William, a pillar of the established order, chooses to help her subvert that order. His action suggests that preserving rigid social hierarchies matters less than preventing specific human tragedies.</p>

<h3 id='the-geography-of-power'>The Geography of Power</h3>

<p>The story traces William's movements through a changing London landscape. His house is no longer in the prestigious parish it once occupied. He goes to Bankside, the Liberty of the Clink outside city jurisdiction, where different social rules apply. He rides to Westminster Palace, where the king's power has superseded London's traditional autonomy. These geographical movements map the redistribution of power from City to Crown, from patrician London to a more pluralistic, royally dominated capital.</p>
