<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>O Be Joyful Carpenter is a Puritan woodcarver born in the winter of 1636, given his extraordinary name as an expression of his family's joy and devotion to God. Apprenticed to the finest woodcarver his father could find, he becomes a skilled craftsman who works on some of the most significant projects of Restoration London, including Wren's St Paul's Cathedral. His life is marked by a profound internal conflict between his exceptional skill and his Puritan convictions, culminating in a spiritual crisis during the Great Fire of 1666 that defines the rest of his days.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>O Be Joyful is described as a short, stocky man. As a youth, he had a sweet and religious nature. No other specific physical description is provided in the text.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>O Be Joyful is fundamentally defined by an internal contradiction: he possesses remarkable talent as a woodcarver but is crippled by self-doubt and what he perceives as his own moral failures. In his youth, he shows "such talent" and "such a sweet and religious nature" that his father <a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1606.html">Gideon Carpenter</a> proudly apprentices him to the finest woodcarver available rather than taking him into the family business. He has a gentle and earnest character, described as "the light of his life" by Gideon.</p>

<p>However, his defining characteristic becomes his crushing sense of unworthiness. Unlike his father and great-aunt <a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha Carpenter</a>, who walked with confidence in their faith, O Be Joyful is haunted by feelings of cowardice and failure. The Great Fire exposes him to himself as "a coward" and "a Judas," and he never recovers from this self-judgment. He is "modest" by nature, making his internal condemnation all the more devastating.</p>

<p>Despite his spiritual despair, he maintains certain standards out of "age and pride" – he cannot bring himself to fully abandon the principles instilled by Martha and Gideon, even when he believes himself damned. He is earnest and serious, lacking the natural authority of his father, but possessing a persistent if troubled conscience.</p>

<p>His relationship with faith is complex and tortured. He believes himself to be one of "the chosen" until Martha's death, after which he becomes convinced he is "unworthy" and "bound for damnation." This crisis of faith does not free him from religious anxiety but instead traps him in a state of perpetual guilt and fear, particularly regarding perceived Catholic conspiracies.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1636-1650-childhood-and-training'>1636-1650: Childhood and Training</h3>

<p>O Be Joyful is born at the end of 1636, the son of <a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1606.html">Gideon Carpenter</a>. His birth brings such joy to the family after years of disappointment that his great-aunt <a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha Carpenter</a> suggests his unusual name as an expression of gratitude to God. Puritan families sometimes took entire phrases from the Bible as names, making "O Be Joyful" an expression of Puritan loyalty that even Archbishop Laud could not object to.</p>

<p>The naming proves strategically brilliant for Gideon's wife, who has been resisting Martha's plans to emigrate to Massachusetts. With such a precious infant to protect, no one would suggest risking him on a dangerous sea voyage during his vulnerable early years. His mother "became quite healthy" after his birth, her mysterious illness fading.</p>

<p>He grows up in the parish of St Lawrence Silversleeves during the tumultuous years of the Civil War, surrounded by the intense Puritan faith of his father and great-aunt. As a youth, he is often seen "reading a bible," displaying the "sweet and religious nature" that makes him the pride of the family. His talent for woodcarving emerges early and is so pronounced that Gideon chooses not to apprentice him in the family repair business but instead places him with "the finest woodcarver he could find."</p>

<h3 id='1642-the-english-civil-war'>1642: The English Civil War</h3>

<p>During his childhood, O Be Joyful witnesses the transformation of London during the Civil War. His father <a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1606.html">Gideon Carpenter</a> becomes an officer in the Parliamentary forces and helps take control of the parish of St Lawrence Silversleeves, removing the Royalist vestry including <a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Sir Julius Ducket</a>. In 1642, at the age of six, young O Be Joyful even accompanies his family to Bocton in Kent for hop-picking, where he "toddled about in the sun" and struck up a curious friendship with Sir Henry Ducket, Julius's Royalist brother.</p>

<h3 id='1650s-1660-training-and-the-commonwealth'>1650s-1660: Training and the Commonwealth</h3>

<p>O Be Joyful comes of age during the Commonwealth period, when Puritan values dominate London. He trains as a woodcarver, learning his craft while theaters remain boarded up and maypoles are absent from the streets. By the time of the Restoration in 1660, he is a skilled journeyman of about twenty-four, though still not a master craftsman. His status as a journeyman who "could only just make out his letters" suggests his education was practical rather than scholarly, focused on his trade.</p>

<h3 id='1665-the-great-plague'>1665: The Great Plague</h3>

<p>By September 1665, O Be Joyful is twenty-nine years old, married with two young children, and living near his aging great-aunt Martha, who has come to live with his family. When the plague spreads toward their neighborhood, he makes the decision to evacuate. His friend and relation by marriage, Dogget the waterman, rows them all to a remarkable refuge: a huge floating island in the Thames constructed by lashing together scores of rafts and wherries. Thousands of Londoners take shelter on these floating structures, reasoning that isolation on the water will protect them from contagion.</p>

<p>O Be Joyful and his family remain on the river for several weeks. The strategy proves remarkably effective – as far as is known, few if any of those on the floating islands catch the plague. By late November, as deaths decline, the family returns to their lodgings in London, where they discover they have gained a small inheritance from <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Wheeler</a>.</p>

<h3 id='september-1666-the-great-fire-and-spiritual-crisis'>September 1666: The Great Fire and Spiritual Crisis</h3>

<p>The Great Fire of London becomes the defining event of O Be Joyful's life, exposing what he perceives as his fundamental cowardice. On the Sunday when the fire begins, he initially underestimates the danger. By Tuesday afternoon, September 4th, with flames steadily approaching, he acts decisively, arranging for his family to shelter at Shoreditch and preparing to evacuate.</p>

<p>Martha insists on checking on her friend Mrs. Bundy, who lives in a tenement halfway down a street already threatened by flames. O Be Joyful accompanies her, but Martha goes inside while he waits outside. The fire advances faster than expected, suddenly bursting through the rear of the buildings. He runs into the hallway calling for Martha but gets no response over the roar of the flames.</p>

<p>He attempts to go up the stairs but encounters heavy smoke, falling beams, and flames bursting from the top floor. His courage fails. He flees back outside without reaching Martha, who he then sees at a small window under the roof. He signals that he is coming, rushes back inside, and starts up the stairs again. But when flames shoot out from the top floor, "his heart failed him." He turns and flees once more, leaving Martha trapped.</p>

<p>From the street, he watches helplessly as Martha's window. He cries for her to jump, though the window is too small and the fall would likely kill her. For a full minute they look at each other across the impossible distance. Then the roof becomes a torch, flames pour from her window, and she is gone.</p>

<p>The experience destroys O Be Joyful spiritually. Initially, he tells himself "there was nothing he could have done" and even manages to sleep believing this. But when he encounters <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Doctor Meredith</a> the next day at Ludgate, watching St Paul's burn, the doctor's quiet courage during the plague pierces his defenses. Meredith had stayed in London risking his life scores of times, showing himself "stout-hearted." O Be Joyful realizes the contrast: "Faint-hearted." Even if Martha could not have been saved, he had not truly tried. He had lost courage on those stairs.</p>

<p>The realization is devastating: "I could have brought her down and saved her. Yet by my fear and cowardice I let her burn." He asks himself whether he is truly the son of Gideon, the spiritual heir of Martha. His answer: "No. He was unworthy."</p>

<h3 id='september-1666-saving-eugene-penny'>September 1666: Saving Eugene Penny</h3>

<p>Later that same day, while walking out along Fleet Street after watching St Paul's burn, O Be Joyful encounters a group of youths threatening a young foreigner with a pike. They accuse the boy of being a Catholic who started the fire. The young man protests in broken English that he is a Huguenot Protestant.</p>

<p>Despite his earlier failure with Martha, O Be Joyful finds his courage. Stepping in front of the boy, he declares: "I am O Be Joyful Carpenter. My father Gideon fought with Cromwell, and this boy is of our faith. Leave him alone or fight me first." The youths reluctantly disperse when a patrol of soldiers appears.</p>

<p>The young Huguenot introduces himself as Eugene de la Penissière, a watchmaker just arrived from France. When O Be Joyful confesses he cannot remember the French name, they agree on "Penny" instead. Eugene calls him "a very brave man" for saving his life, words that ring hollow to O Be Joyful but which establish a lasting friendship. He escorts the young man to safety at the Savoy, where there is a French Protestant community.</p>

<h3 id='1666-1670-aftermath-and-depression'>1666-1670: Aftermath and Depression</h3>

<p>After the Fire, O Be Joyful does not immediately return to his family but wanders about watching the destruction. As he does so, Eugene's words – "a brave man" – mock him. He knows the truth: "I could have brought her down and saved her. Yet by my fear and cowardice I let her burn."</p>

<p>The vision that sustained Gideon and Martha – of building a shining city of God in London – seems destroyed along with the physical city. As the fire advances along Fleet Street "like some powerful chariot of destruction," its crackles seem to grind out a terrible message: "All gone. All destroyed. All gone."</p>

<p>O Be Joyful concludes he is unworthy of Gideon and Martha's legacy. Yet he cannot escape the world they created. In the years after the Fire, as London rebuilds, he works steadily as a journeyman carpenter. With houses going up by the thousands, there is enormous demand for "doors, panelling, wood-carving of every kind."</p>

<h3 id='c-1673-working-with-grinling-gibbons'>c. 1673: Working with Grinling Gibbons</h3>

<p>Around 1673, <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Doctor Meredith</a>, now ordained as a clergyman at St Bride's in Fleet Street, encounters O Be Joyful and sees his "gloomy face." Meredith has already helped O Be Joyful's friend Eugene <a href="characters/Eugene-Penny-1648.html">Penny</a> find a position with the great clockmaker Tompion, and he now seeks to help the carpenter.</p>

<p>Meredith introduces O Be Joyful to Grinling Gibbons, a remarkable woodcarver recently patronized by the King and engaged by Christopher Wren to work on his new churches. O Be Joyful is astounded by Gibbons's work – carvings of human figures, animals, trees, fruit, and flowers with such individuality and lightness "you almost reached out to touch it believing it was real." He whispers to Meredith: "He is a sculptor, not just a carver."</p>

<p>Meredith offers to help O Be Joyful join Gibbons's workshop and work on Wren's new churches. But despite his admiration for the craftsmanship, O Be Joyful cannot bring himself to accept. Working in churches with the Prayer Book, vestments, and bishops would insult the memory of Martha and Gideon. "Sunk though he was in sin, he could not insult their memory by doing that."</p>

<p>However, Meredith points out that Gibbons is also working on St Paul's Cathedral – a building paid for not by the king but by a special coal tax. "Every time the ships from Newcastle docked at London with the coal for its home fires, the unloaded sacks were taxed. And for every three shillings of tax, fourpence halfpenny went straight to St Paul's." This public funding makes it different from the royal churches. After internal struggle, O Be Joyful joins Gibbons's workshop.</p>

<h3 id='1674-1675-the-great-model'>1674-1675: The Great Model</h3>

<p>Gibbons sends O Be Joyful to work on an extraordinary project: a massive wooden model of Wren's proposed design for St Paul's. At a scale of half an inch to every foot, the model is twenty feet long and almost eight feet high, constructed of oak with every detail exactly reproduced inside and out. O Be Joyful works on the Corinthian columns and pilasters, finding satisfaction in their "chaste simplicity," though the oak is "the devil to carve."</p>

<p>Despite his spiritual despair, he begins to feel "quite proud of his task." <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Doctor Meredith</a> shows him the boreholes that have been sunk for the foundations – going down through Roman remains, past Saxon levels, through sand and seashells from "the time of Noah," until reaching hard gravel and clay over forty feet down. O Be Joyful marvels that "the foundations of the new church should grow in this manner from the days of the Flood."</p>

<p>But when the drawings for the roof arrive, O Be Joyful is horrified. Over the central crossing, Wren has designed a huge drum ringed with columns, and over that a magnificent dome. To O Be Joyful and other workers, the significance is unmistakable: "It's just like St Peter's – at the Vatican. It's the church of Rome." Terrified, he runs from the workshop.</p>

<p>Meredith tries to reassure him: "The form of the building does not affect the religion." The Catholics worship in churches of every shape, and Wren himself is the son of an Anglican clergyman, no papist. But O Be Joyful is unconvinced, particularly about King Charles II, whose court seems increasingly tolerant of Catholicism and whose brother and heir James is an open Catholic.</p>

<p>Sadly and with doubt in his heart, O Be Joyful returns to work. He repeatedly asks Gibbons for other assignments, but his work on the model is too good to spare. "Slowly he carved the columns and capitals round the great dome, sadly he put the finishing touches, from a ladder, to the top; miserably he watched as the junior workmen and apprentices polished the huge oaken model until it shone like bronze."</p>

<h3 id='c-1676-the-approved-design'>c. 1676: The Approved Design</h3>

<p>A few weeks after completing the Great Model, O Be Joyful encounters Meredith in Cheapside, and the clergyman has surprising news: the Great Model has been rejected. "The Church authorities didn't like the popish dome either." He shows O Be Joyful the new approved design – a longer, thinner building with a tall classical spire instead of a dome. It is "somewhat ungainly-looking," not what one would expect from Wren, but it satisfies the main requirement: no dome.</p>

<p>Work begins at once on this new design, and O Be Joyful is invited to witness an impromptu ceremony at the site with other craftsmen. Christopher Wren needs a stone to mark the central spot of the church and, noting O Be Joyful's unusual name, asks him to go find one: "O Be Joyful, what more perfect name for such a mission!" The company laughs with simple good humor.</p>

<p>But to O Be Joyful, "the laughter contained a note of mockery." He believes they are laughing at his foolishness, suspecting he does not know the secret. He and a mason find a flat piece broken from a gravestone bearing a single Latin word that O Be Joyful cannot understand. When they return with it, Wren claps his hands in delight: the stone reads "RESURGAM" – Latin for "I shall rise again."</p>

<p>Wren calls it providence, and they place the stone face up at the center of the church's floor. But "O Be Joyful did not even smile." The very next day after seeing the new drawings, he became convinced that "the designs for St Paul's were a fake to keep everyone quiet while Wren played for time." The ugly, clumsy structure in the drawings is inconceivable as Wren's true intention. Therefore, "He was planning to build a papist cathedral, with a papist dome."</p>

<p>O Be Joyful concludes that Wren "looks like an Anglican" and "says he's a Freemason, but really he's a Jesuit, full of lies." Ashamed and bound for damnation though he is, he makes a secret vow: "If he builds a dome, I'll refuse to work in this church, even if Gibbons dismisses me."</p>

<h3 id='1677-1679-mounting-paranoia'>1677-1679: Mounting Paranoia</h3>

<p>O Be Joyful's suspicions intensify as work proceeds. Wren lays out the entire foundation before building up, rather than completing the eastern end first. When O Be Joyful visits the drawing office to see the plans again, a clerk tells him there are none: "Sir Christopher took them all away." There is only a ground plan – no elevations, no models. "All Wren does is provide drawings of the sections we're working on. I suppose it's all in his head."</p>

<p>In spring 1678, a series of celestial events seems to confirm divine displeasure: two eclipses of the moon and three eclipses of the sun. O Be Joyful sees these as "terrible signs." When Meredith tries to explain that eclipses can be precisely predicted through natural laws, O Be Joyful is further alarmed. The universe as Meredith describes it sounds "like a machine, strangely godless." He worries that Meredith's science and the Royal Society "may not all be the work of the Devil too."</p>

<p>Then comes the bombshell: Titus Oates reveals a supposed Popish Plot to assassinate the king and restore Catholicism. To O Be Joyful, this confirms all his worst fears about Wren and St Paul's. He would like to denounce Wren but knows he would simply lose his job and not be believed. Instead, he joins some Whig marches through 1678 and 1679, wearing the green ribbons of the party opposing Catholic succession.</p>

<h3 id='summer-1679-confirmation-of-betrayal'>Summer 1679: Confirmation of Betrayal</h3>

<p>In summer 1679, O Be Joyful's worst fears are confirmed. By this time, the walls of St Paul's are rising, and one day Gibbons tells him: "We're going to need you on the dome, you know." O Be Joyful stares at him, and Gibbons casually explains: "Didn't you know? We're building the dome after all. It's called a Royal Warrant. The king can do what he likes."</p>

<p>The revelation is crushing. For two years, workers have been building according to the warranted design with the spire, but now they are to build the dome instead. O Be Joyful confronts the truth: he has been working "on the whore of Babylon" for six years. "I am guilty. Guilty."</p>

<p>He is additionally tormented by <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Doctor Meredith</a>'s tolerance. The clergyman refuses to worry about the popish plot, trusts that the king and Church are sound, and even explains celestial events through natural causes rather than divine signs. O Be Joyful concludes: "I wonder if his science, his Royal Society and Observatory may not all be the work of the Devil too."</p>

<h3 id='c-1680-1690-final-years'>c. 1680-1690: Final Years</h3>

<p>True to his vow, O Be Joyful refuses to work further on St Paul's once the dome construction begins. Whether Gibbons dismisses him or he finds other work is not recorded. The text ends with his recognition of his "guilt" at having worked on what he believes is a papist cathedral for six years.</p>

<p>Given his age (forty-three in 1679), it is likely he continued working as a woodcarver in London through the 1680s, but his fate after the St Paul's crisis is not recorded. He probably died sometime around 1690, by which point he would have been about fifty-four.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='martha-carpenter'>Martha Carpenter</h3>

<p><a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha Carpenter</a>, O Be Joyful's great-aunt, is the most important spiritual influence in his life. She suggests his name at his baptism, expressing the family's joy and Puritan devotion. As he grows up, she serves as his "spiritual guide," embodying the confident Puritan faith of the Commonwealth era. After the plague, when she is weakened, she comes to live with O Be Joyful and his family.</p>

<p>Her death in the Great Fire becomes the defining trauma of O Be Joyful's life. When he fails to save her from the burning building, he concludes he is unworthy to be her spiritual heir. The question haunts him: "Am I the son of Gideon, the spiritual heir of Martha? No. He was unworthy." Even decades later, working on St Paul's, he cannot bring himself to insult her memory by working in the king's churches, though he makes an exception for the cathedral.</p>

<h3 id='gideon-carpenter'>Gideon Carpenter</h3>

<p>O Be Joyful's father <a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1606.html">Gideon Carpenter</a> is a formidable figure – a Civil War officer and respected Puritan leader in the parish. Gideon delights in his son, calling him "the light of his life" and recognizing his exceptional talent early. Rather than apprenticing O Be Joyful in the family business, Gideon finds him "the finest woodcarver" available, showing both his pride in his son and his ambition for him.</p>

<p>But this very pride becomes a burden. After Martha's death, O Be Joyful feels he has failed to live up to Gideon's example. The question torments him: "Was he the son of Gideon?" His answer – that he is unworthy – shapes the rest of his life.</p>

<h3 id='doctor-richard-meredith'>Doctor Richard Meredith</h3>

<p><a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a>, the minister at St Lawrence Silversleeves and later St Bride's, maintains a friendly relationship with O Be Joyful throughout his life. Meredith baptized O Be Joyful as an infant, announcing with "a wry glance" the unusual name. Later, he actively helps O Be Joyful's career, introducing him to Grinling Gibbons and attempting to alleviate his fears about Wren's plans.</p>

<p>But Meredith's rational, scientific worldview increasingly troubles O Be Joyful. As a member of the Royal Society, Meredith explains eclipses through natural causes and speaks of the universe as a vast mechanical system. To O Be Joyful, this sounds "strangely godless," and he begins to worry that even Meredith, "a good man," might "unwittingly be on the path to hell." Their relationship illustrates the growing divide between Enlightenment rationalism and traditional religious anxiety.</p>

<h3 id='eugene-penny'>Eugene Penny</h3>

<p>O Be Joyful saves the young Huguenot <a href="characters/Eugene-Penny-1648.html">Eugene Penny</a> from a mob during the Great Fire, establishing a lasting friendship. Eugene calls him "a very brave man," though the praise rings hollow to O Be Joyful given his failure to save Martha. Nevertheless, he helps Eugene settle in London, and later Meredith helps the watchmaker find excellent employment.</p>

<p>Their friendship is significant because Eugene is also a Protestant refugee, someone who shares O Be Joyful's anxieties about Catholicism. Eugene remarks that the Fire "was surely the work of Catholics," a view that resonates with O Be Joyful's paranoia about popish plots.</p>

<h3 id='grinling-gibbons'>Grinling Gibbons</h3>

<p>Gibbons, the master woodcarver, employs O Be Joyful and clearly values his skill, assigning him important work on the Great Model and keeping him on that project despite his requests for other assignments. "His work was too good to be spared." Gibbons is described as "a quiet craftsman," suggesting he and O Be Joyful share a certain temperament.</p>

<p>However, their relationship becomes strained by O Be Joyful's religious anxieties. When Gibbons casually reveals that they will be building the dome after all, he seems unaware of the crisis this will cause for O Be Joyful. The master carver represents a pragmatic approach to craft that separates skill from religious controversy – an approach O Be Joyful cannot adopt.</p>

<h3 id='christopher-wren'>Christopher Wren</h3>

<p>O Be Joyful never has a close personal relationship with the great architect, but Wren becomes a central figure in his spiritual torment. At first, O Be Joyful sees nothing sinister in Wren – just the son of an Anglican clergyman, a brilliant architect and scientist. But as his paranoia grows, fueled by the dome design and the Popish Plot revelations, he becomes convinced that Wren "looks like an Anglican" and "says he's a Freemason, but really he's a Jesuit, full of lies."</p>

<p>This conclusion causes O Be Joyful profound guilt, since he has been working on Wren's St Paul's for six years. When he finally realizes the dome will be built after all, he feels complicit in building "the whore of Babylon."</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>O Be Joyful Carpenter lived through one of the most tumultuous periods in English history, and his personal crisis mirrors the religious and political anxieties of his age.</p>

<p>He was born in 1636, in the decade when tensions between King Charles I and Parliament were building toward civil war. His unusual Puritan name reflects the confident religious identity of his family during a time when Puritanism was a powerful force in London. The name "O Be Joyful" would have marked him immediately as coming from a godly family of the reformed faith.</p>

<p>His childhood coincided with the English Civil War (1642-1651), and his father fought on the Parliamentary side. By the time of the Commonwealth and Protectorate (1649-1660), Puritan values dominated London society. Theaters were closed, maypoles removed, and the established church dismantled. This was the London of O Be Joyful's youth – a time when he and his family could believe they were building a "shining city" of God.</p>

<p>The Restoration of Charles II in 1660 brought a profound reversal. The monarchy returned, theaters reopened, the Anglican church was reestablished with its bishops and ceremony, and those who refused to conform faced restrictions. Puritans like O Be Joyful lost political power and found themselves increasingly marginalized. The vision of a godly commonwealth was dead.</p>

<p>The Great Plague of 1665 killed perhaps 100,000 Londoners. The floating refuges on the Thames, where O Be Joyful sheltered with thousands of others, represent one of the more ingenious survival strategies of that terrible time. The fact that these river colonies largely escaped infection was noticed by Doctor Meredith, though he could not explain it. (Modern medicine understands that the isolation from rats and their plague-carrying fleas was the key.)</p>

<p>The Great Fire of 1666 destroyed the medieval city within the walls. It created both enormous destruction and an extraordinary opportunity for rebuilding. The demand for craftsmen was immense, and skilled workers like O Be Joyful found steady employment. But the popular belief that Catholics had started the fire reflects the deep religious paranoia of the era. O Be Joyful's encounter with the mob threatening Eugene Penny illustrates how easily religious fear could turn violent.</p>

<p>The Popish Plot of 1678-1681, "revealed" by Titus Oates, was largely fictitious, but it caused genuine panic. The fear of Catholic conspiracy to assassinate the Protestant king and restore Catholic rule seemed plausible to many, especially given that the king's brother and heir, James, was openly Catholic. The Whig faction, whose green ribbons O Be Joyful wears, opposed Catholic succession and sought to exclude James from the throne.</p>

<p>Christopher Wren's rebuilding of London, particularly St Paul's Cathedral, represents the triumph of a new, rationalist approach to religion and knowledge. Wren was a founding member of the Royal Society, which promoted empirical investigation and mathematical precision. His architectural vision blended classical forms with innovative engineering. The coal tax that funded St Paul's was itself an example of the growing fiscal sophistication of the English state.</p>

<p>But to someone like O Be Joyful, educated in the Puritan tradition and haunted by guilt, Wren's dome could only be interpreted as crypto-Catholic. The fact that Wren did indeed build the dome despite official approval for a different design suggests that O Be Joyful was not entirely wrong to feel deceived, even if he was wrong about the motivations. Wren used the "Royal Warrant" – the king's personal authority – to override the approved plans, a reminder that in Restoration England, royal prerogative remained powerful.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>O Be Joyful Carpenter represents the personal cost of England's religious and political upheavals. Born into the confident Puritanism of the 1630s, apprenticed during the Commonwealth, he comes of age just as the Restoration undoes everything his family stood for. Unlike his father Gideon, a Civil War officer, or his great-aunt Martha, a confident moral leader, O Be Joyful lacks their certainty. He inherits their values but not their assurance.</p>

<p>The Great Fire becomes the lens through which he sees his own inadequacy. Martha's death is both a real tragedy and a symbolic one: the end of the heroic Puritan generation and the exposure of his own unworthiness. His inability to save her mirrors his inability to save the Puritan vision of England. The city that rises from the ashes is not the "shining city" Martha and Gideon envisioned but a restored monarchy with an Anglican cathedral topped by what looks to him like the dome of St Peter's in Rome.</p>

<p>His story illustrates the psychological burden of religious anxiety. Convinced he is damned, he nonetheless cannot free himself from religious categories. He continues to judge everything through a religious lens – Wren's architecture, Meredith's science, the eclipses, the Popish Plot. His guilt over working on St Paul's demonstrates how people caught between historical eras can feel complicit in changes they cannot control or comprehend.</p>

<p>His relationship with his craft adds another dimension. Despite his spiritual despair, O Be Joyful is exceptionally skilled. His work on the Great Model is so good that Gibbons cannot spare him for other tasks. He takes pride in his craftsmanship even while believing himself damned. This split between his identity as a craftsman and his identity as a believer reflects a broader cultural shift: the emergence of secular expertise and professional identity separate from religious confession.</p>

<p>The name "O Be Joyful" becomes bitterly ironic. Given as an expression of joy and gratitude, it becomes a daily reminder of his failure to live up to that joy. Yet the scene where Wren asks him to find the foundation stone, calling his name perfect for such a mission, shows that others see the name differently – as simply charming or quaint, stripped of its original religious intensity.</p>

<p>Finally, O Be Joyful's paranoia about the Popish Plot and Wren's "Jesuit" deceptions represents the difficulty of distinguishing real threats from imagined ones in times of rapid change. He is not entirely wrong to notice that powerful people have religious sympathies different from his own, or that architectural decisions are being made without public transparency. But his interpretation of these facts through a lens of conspiracy and damnation prevents him from seeing the more complex reality: that England is moving toward a more pluralistic and secular society, however unevenly and imperfectly.</p>

<p>In the end, O Be Joyful Carpenter is a figure of pathos – a talented craftsman whose crisis of conscience reflects the agonizing transition from the world of Puritan certainty to the world of Enlightenment rationalism, a man who helps build a new London while convinced he is building Babylon.</p>
