<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Maisie Fleming was the wife of <a href="characters/Herbert-Fleming-1875.html">Herbert Fleming</a> and sister-in-law to <a href="characters/Percy-Fleming-1875.html">Percy Fleming</a>. A lower middle-class housewife living at Crystal Palace, she embodied the social aspirations and domestic standards of the Edwardian suburban clerk's wife. She died in 1940 during the Blitz when she was struck by anti-aircraft shrapnel while watching a dogfight above Crystal Palace.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Maisie was rather short with a small birthmark on her neck. She had a red mouth and tiny, sharp-looking little teeth, and sharp eyes that missed little.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Maisie was defined by her keen social consciousness and domestic pride. She maintained exacting standards in her home, working her single housemaid "to death" to ensure every square inch of her villa was polished and gleaming. Her sitting room featured antimacassars on every chair, a large potted plant, and a painting of a mountain that her father had bought in Brighton.</p>

<p>She was socially ambitious within her modest sphere, protective of the Fleming family's reputation in the Crystal Palace neighborhood. When <a href="characters/Percy-Fleming-1875.html">Percy</a> brought <a href="characters/Jenny-Fleming-1879.html">Jenny Ducket</a> to meet her, Maisie's sharp eyes immediately assessed Jenny's clothes and she probed to determine Jenny's social background. Upon learning Jenny was in service, she made her disapproval clear: "We've never had anyone in service in our family, of course. Or Herbert's."</p>

<p>Despite her social pretensions, Maisie had a jolly side. She and Herbert prided themselves on being fun-loving, attending music halls monthly, and Herbert would perform the entire show back at home the next evening. Maisie belonged to a drama society and had "a lovely singing voice." Their favorite summer activity was bicycling together on Sunday afternoons.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1908-1910-marriage-and-domestic-life'>1908-1910: Marriage and Domestic Life</h3>

<p>Maisie had married <a href="characters/Herbert-Fleming-1875.html">Herbert Fleming</a> and they established their household at Crystal Palace. Before marriage, she had inherited five hundred pounds – not a fortune, but enough to buy their house and have some money left over. This modest financial security placed them comfortably in the respectable lower middle class.</p>

<p>Their villa was a two-storey house over a half-basement with a small lawn and privet hedge at the front. Though an evergreen tree next door made it somewhat dark, the interior was meticulously maintained. Maisie kept her dining room with a round table – the same one from her childhood home, though it had been in a bigger room then.</p>

<p>She and Herbert had no children but created a life centered on suburban sociability and entertainment. They were regular attendees at music halls and Maisie participated actively in a local drama society where she could showcase her singing voice.</p>

<h3 id='1910-meeting-jenny'>1910: Meeting Jenny</h3>

<p>When Percy brought Jenny to Sunday lunch, Maisie served roast chicken "with all the trimmings," carved with theatrical flourishes by Herbert. Throughout the meal, her sharp eyes studied Jenny's clothes – recognizing them as hand-me-downs from an employer.</p>

<p>Maisie had considered it her "little project" to find Percy a suitable wife who would "do credit to them all." She worried that if Percy married beneath them, it would affect the Fleming family's standing in Crystal Palace. After the brothers went outside, she confronted Jenny directly: "I know what you do. You're in service, aren't you?" When Jenny confirmed this and added tartly, "We've never had anyone in service in our family, of course. Or Herbert's," followed by Jenny's sharp response "No. I don't suppose you ever will, either," Maisie replied, "Oh. That's all right then."</p>

<p>Despite this rocky introduction, after Percy and Jenny's marriage, Maisie and Jenny "had learned to get on together," though they never became close.</p>

<h3 id='1940-the-blitz'>1940: The Blitz</h3>

<p>By the time of the Blitz, Maisie and Herbert were in their sixties. Herbert worked nights at the local Fire Brigade substation, helping out despite Maisie's wish that he would stay with her. "But it's good for them to be together," Jenny told her, understanding the brothers' bond.</p>

<p>On the afternoon before her death, Maisie and Jenny had gone to see <i>Gone with the Wind</i> to take their minds off the bombing. The previous night they had stood together in Percy and Jenny's garden watching as waves of German planes droned overhead and fires lit up the East End.</p>

<p>That evening, as the raids began, Maisie could never sleep until the All Clear sounded at dawn. Just after one in the morning, she slipped out of her house and walked up to the crest of the ridge. She planned to go to Jenny's house, knowing the front door would be unlocked even if Jenny were asleep.</p>

<p>At the top of the ridge near Gipsy Hill, she paused to watch the scene below. London pulsated with molten red light "as if some vast geological change had taken place and the whole shallow bowl had transformed itself into the mouth of a volcano."</p>

<p>A wave of enemy planes droned overhead, and then Maisie heard a buzzing, whining sound – fighters. She watched half a dozen planes swoop through the night sky, their guns flashing. Messerschmitts swarmed up like angry hornets. Over Dulwich, towards Clapham and the river, the planes looped and wheeled in aerial combat. "It was, in its way, rather thrilling," the book notes.</p>

<p>Two planes detached from the rest and headed back over Crystal Palace, wheeling directly over her only a few hundred feet up. She gazed up, fascinated, her "small red mouth forming into a little circle." Without realizing what she was doing, she waved her arms and cried out: "Come on! Get him! You can do it."</p>

<p>As another wave of bombers came over and anti-aircraft guns erupted into a frenzy, Maisie craned her neck and spun round to look for the returning fighters, the whole sky flashing. "She never saw or felt the sudden hail of shrapnel that crashed into the back of her head and caused it to explode like a little cherry."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='herbert-fleming'>Herbert Fleming</h3>

<p>Maisie and Herbert had a companionable marriage without children. They shared a love of entertainment, regularly attending music halls together. Herbert's theatrical personality complemented Maisie's more socially conscious nature. She supported his involvement with the drama society where he performed, and they maintained the suburban ideal of respectability and modest jollity. Though she wished he would stay with her during the Blitz rather than help at the fire station, she understood his need to be useful and his bond with his brother Percy.</p>

<h3 id='percy-fleming'>Percy Fleming</h3>

<p>As Herbert's younger brother, Percy was someone Maisie felt responsible for in terms of maintaining family respectability. She had planned to find him a suitable wife and was dismayed when he brought Jenny, a domestic servant, to meet them. However, she eventually accepted the situation, particularly after Jenny made clear she would not be looked down upon.</p>

<h3 id='jenny-ducketfleming'>Jenny Ducket/Fleming</h3>

<p>The relationship between Maisie and Jenny began awkwardly with Maisie's class-conscious interrogation and barely concealed disapproval. However, over the decades they learned to coexist peacefully, even spending time together during the Blitz going to films and standing together to watch the bombing. They never became close friends, but achieved a working détente as sisters-in-law.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Maisie represented the expanded clerical class that emerged during the Victorian and Edwardian periods. The vast scale of London's trading operations, banks, insurance companies, and imperial administration required an army of clerks. Because there were now trains and spreading suburbs that were cheaper and more healthful, this hugely expanded class commuted to work by the thousands.</p>

<p>Men like Herbert, whose parents or grandparents had been shopkeepers or craftsmen, now put on suits and took the train to offices. Their wives, who would formerly have lived by workshops or helped in shops, were left alone at home. Considering themselves "a cut above women who worked," they took on "in whatever small ways they could afford, the mannerisms of ladies of leisure."</p>

<p>Maisie's meticulous housekeeping, her drama society participation, her music hall attendance, and especially her concern for respectability and social position were all characteristic of this new suburban middle class. The five hundred pounds she inherited – enough to buy a house with some left over – placed her and Herbert securely in this respectable stratum.</p>

<p>Her death during the Blitz represented the vulnerability of civilians in modern warfare. Standing on the ridge above London, watching the air battle with a kind of naive fascination – even cheering on the British fighters – she was killed not by a bomb but by the very defenses meant to protect London. The anti-aircraft shrapnel that killed her showed how the distinction between combatant and civilian had collapsed in total war.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Maisie embodies the social stratification and aspirations of Edwardian suburban life. Though her own family's background was modest, she carefully guarded what respectability she and Herbert had achieved. Her concern that Percy not marry "beneath them" showed how even those of relatively humble circumstances maintained fine distinctions of social hierarchy.</p>

<p>Her character illustrates the particular position of the clerk's wife in early twentieth-century London – maintaining domestic standards, participating in local cultural activities, and preserving respectability on a modest income. The pride she took in her inherited money and her purchased house reflected the importance of property and financial security to this class.</p>

<p>Her death is particularly poignant and ironic. After decades of maintaining her respectable suburban life, she was killed not by enemy action directly, but by friendly fire – shrapnel from British anti-aircraft guns. Standing alone in the night watching the air battle "in its way, rather thrilling," she was caught up in the mechanized violence of modern warfare that made no distinction between soldier and civilian, between the strategic target and the spectator.</p>

<p>The description of her death – her small red mouth forming a circle as she cheered on the fighters, moments before shrapnel caused her head to "explode like a little cherry" – captures both her innocence and the brutal reality of the Blitz. In the end, the respectability and domestic order she had so carefully maintained meant nothing against the random violence of total war.</p>
