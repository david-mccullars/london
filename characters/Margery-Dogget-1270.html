<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Margery Dogget is an identical twin sister working as a prostitute at the Dog's Head brothel on Bankside in 1295. Together with her twin <a href="characters/Isobel-Dogget-1270.html">Isobel</a>, she is part of a colorful, kind-hearted pair known throughout Southwark for their distinctive appearance, adventurous spirit, and willingness to help those in distress. The sisters' scheme to save <a href="characters/Joan-Fleming-1280.html">Joan Fleming</a>'s beloved from hanging becomes the central plot of their story, complicated by Margery's sudden illness with syphilis.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Margery and her sister are tall and stringy with thick tresses of black hair, big black eyes, and prominent buck teeth. They possess slim bodies with rather heavy breasts and a remarkable sexuality. Their voices, when they laugh, make a surprisingly deep sound "like a donkey's braying." Most distinctively, each sister has a streak of white hair over the center of her forehead in her black tresses.</p>

<p>The twins are so identical that even the brothelkeeper of the Dog's Head cannot tell which is which. They always dress identically, enhancing their indistinguishability.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Margery is fundamentally kind-hearted and adventurous. When she and Isobel encounter <a href="characters/Joan-Fleming-1280.html">Joan</a> in floods of tears outside St Paul's, their immediate response is to help her with an elaborate scheme, demonstrating both their compassion and their love of excitement. The twins are described as having one thing they love best above all: an adventure.</p>

<p>She is quick-thinking and resourceful in crisis situations. When faced with the dual challenges of her illness and Joan's predicament, she and her twin devise clever solutions on the spot. Their ability to sit in silence, muttering to each other, and then emerge with a plan is shown multiple times throughout the story.</p>

<p>Margery demonstrates remarkable loyalty to her sister. She has never been away from Isobel before and the prospect troubles her, even when her health is at stake. The twins operate almost as a single unit, finishing each other's thoughts and acting in perfect coordination.</p>

<p>Despite her profession, Margery maintains certain moral boundaries and genuine concern for others. She and her sister promise to protect Joan's virginity through her ordeal at the brothel and work diligently to keep that promise, even when their own circumstances become dire.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-1295-family-background'>Early 1295: Family Background</h3>

<p>Margery and Isobel belong to a branch of the formerly respectable Ducket family that has fallen into the underclass of Southwark. Their situation traces back eighty years earlier when Adam Ducket lost the freedom of London and, in bitterness, refused help from the Barnikel family. He drifted to Southwark where he set up a failed market stall, then worked in a tavern and married a serving girl. Within a generation, the family had sunk into poverty.</p>

<p>The twins have become so well-known and associated with their brothel that they acquired a professional name. Originally Duckets, they became known as "the Dog's Head girls," which gradually transformed into the surname "Dogget." The family has five members plus a dozen cousins, all living in Southwark, and all described as "cheerful, irrepressible, and disreputable."</p>

<h3 id='november-1295-the-discovery-of-illness'>November 1295: The Discovery of Illness</h3>

<p>A few days before the main events, Margery discovers a small sore that burns painfully. When examined by her sister on the slopes away from Bankside, Isobel immediately recognizes the danger. The bishop's bailiff inspects all prostitutes monthly, and any with disease are expelled from the Liberty of the Clink. Margery has contracted "the burning sickness" - a form of syphilis, less severe than later strains but contagious and serious.</p>

<p>The sisters lament the recent expulsion of the Jews from England (in 1290). The old Jewish doctor had known how to treat the burning sickness with mercury, but now no one has that knowledge. Margery visits a doctor in Maiden Lane who, for a bribe, promises to keep silent. He diagnoses it as "a leprosy" (as all such contagious sores were called), bathes it in white wine, and gives her an ointment made chiefly of goat urine, claiming it will cure her.</p>

<p>This crisis occupies the twins' minds so completely that they initially forget about Joan, whom they had promised to protect.</p>

<h3 id='november-1295-joans-plan'>November 1295: Joan's Plan</h3>

<p>Two days before Parliament convenes, Margery and Isobel encounter Joan in floods of tears outside St Paul's. After hearing her story - that her beloved <a href="characters/Martin-Fleming-1277.html">Martin Fleming</a> has been wrongly convicted of theft and will hang - the sisters devise an extraordinary plan. Joan will register as a prostitute at the Dog's Head for a single day, then claim Martin at the gallows using the ancient law that allows a prostitute to save a condemned man by marrying him.</p>

<p>"We must help her," the sisters say together, and they promise to protect Joan's virginity through the ordeal. The twins find the whole scheme tremendously exciting - "What a joke," they cry, "What a trick."</p>

<h3 id='november-1295-the-crisis-at-the-dogs-head'>November 1295: The Crisis at the Dog's Head</h3>

<p>On the crucial day, with Parliament about to convene and the brothel supposed to be closed, Margery faces a dilemma. She cannot work in her condition - if a customer caught the disease from her, particularly someone important like Alderman <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a>, there would be "all hell to pay." Isobel advises her not to work that night, and they plan to decide what to do in the morning.</p>

<p>However, when Barnikel arrives demanding "the Dogget girl" he always has - specifically Margery - the sisters face an impossible situation. In a split-second decision, one sister steps forward claiming to be Margery, protecting both Barnikel from infection and Margery from discovery. There is no time to talk between them; the subterfuge happens instantaneously. Margery later reflects that Isobel had told her "long ago, exactly what it was he liked," allowing the deception to work seamlessly.</p>

<h3 id='night-of-november-1295-the-elaborate-trick-on-silversleeves'>Night of November 1295: The Elaborate Trick on Silversleeves</h3>

<p>That evening brings another crisis. <a href="characters/Dionysius-Silversleeves-1266.html">Dionysius Silversleeves</a>, a clerk from the Royal Mint, arrives demanding Joan. When Isobel tries to protect Joan by claiming she's sick, the brothelkeeper overrules her. Margery and Isobel sit together on a mattress with their chins on their hands, muttering to each other. After what seems an age to the anxious Joan, they emerge with a plan, laughing their characteristic hoarse laugh.</p>

<p>The sisters implement an elaborate scheme to get Silversleeves drunk. "What we need is food," says Margery. "And wine," adds Isobel. "Let's sup," they cry together. They sit on either side of Silversleeves, filling his beaker repeatedly, encouraging him to eat beef and apple tart, singing songs with him, all while Joan sits on his lap in Isobel's best red silk nightgown, keeping him occupied and content to wait.</p>

<p>When Silversleeves finally insists on taking Joan upstairs, the twins execute the second phase. In the pitch darkness of the cold November night, with the east wind rattling shutters and the lantern extinguished, they assault him on the stairs. First one sister tugs at him on the first landing - "Come with me. Sleep with me, lover" - pressing her coarse pale dress against him until he throws her aside. Then the other seizes him on the second floor, pulling him past the attic stairs, dragging him into a room with incoherent murmurs of love and lust. "Take me. Oh take me any way you want me." He has to wrestle with her and knock her down before breaking free.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the attic, the final switch occurs. While Joan enters ahead of the drunken Silversleeves and hides under a blanket in the corner, one twin slips into a silk nightgown identical to Joan's and lies down on the mattress. In the pitch darkness, with Silversleeves's head swimming from drink and confusion, he mounts the Dogget sister, believing her to be Joan. The plan works perfectly.</p>

<h3 id='the-revelation'>The Revelation</h3>

<p>The chapter ends with a dramatic reveal that occurs after Christmas. <a href="characters/Dionysius-Silversleeves-1266.html">Dionysius Silversleeves</a> begins experiencing a burning sensation in his private parts. The narrator reveals: "It was Margery, not Isobel, that he had slept with."</p>

<p>This means it was Margery who took Joan's place in the attic, sacrificing her own secrecy about the disease to save Joan's virginity and, ultimately, Martin Fleming's life. Meanwhile, it was Isobel who slept with Barnikel earlier that evening, resulting in her pregnancy - "I'm definitely pregnant and I'm sure it's him," she tells Margery.</p>

<h3 id='after-the-events-pilgrimage-to-canterbury'>After the Events: Pilgrimage to Canterbury</h3>

<p>The day after Martin and Joan's wedding, where the twins serve as bridesmaids, Margery and Isobel leave London. They have "a reason for absence which not even the bishop could quarrel with" - they go on pilgrimage to Canterbury.</p>

<p>While away, Margery continues using the doctor's goat-urine ointment. To her great surprise, by the time they return, it appears to be working. Whether the ointment truly cured her or the disease entered a latent phase remains unclear, but her immediate crisis has passed.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='isobel-doggetisobel-dogget-1270html'><a href="characters/Isobel-Dogget-1270.html">Isobel Dogget</a></h3>

<p>Margery's identical twin sister is the most important relationship in her life. They are inseparable, always dressing identically, speaking in tandem, living in adjacent rooms at the Dog's Head. They share customers for "a modest discount" and can carry on a party "all night" if a client has the stamina. More significantly, they communicate almost telepathically, able to devise complex plans through mere muttering while sitting together.</p>

<p>Margery has "never been away from her sister before" and the prospect deeply troubles her. Isobel is explicitly described as the religious one who believes God might forgive her sins and save her in the end, but both sisters share the same fundamental kindness and love of adventure. Their bond is so strong that no one, not even their employer, can tell them apart.</p>

<h3 id='joan-flemingjoan-fleming-1280html'><a href="characters/Joan-Fleming-1280.html">Joan Fleming</a></h3>

<p>Though they meet Joan only days before the main events, Margery and Isobel immediately commit to helping her in her desperate situation. They devise the original plan to save Martin Fleming and promise repeatedly to protect Joan's virginity. When circumstances threaten that promise, Margery herself takes Joan's place with Silversleeves, contracting syphilis to him and potentially endangering Joan's entire scheme if discovered, but ensuring Joan remains untouched. Margery and Isobel serve as bridesmaids at Joan and Martin's wedding.</p>

<h3 id='waldus-barnikelwaldus-barnikel-1248html'><a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a></h3>

<p>Barnikel is described as a regular customer who always requests "the Dogget girl" - specifically Margery. He knows exactly which twin he prefers and what he likes. However, Margery has shared these details with Isobel long ago, enabling Isobel to successfully impersonate her when necessary. On the crucial night, when Margery's condition makes her dangerous to customers, Isobel substitutes for her with Barnikel, a deception he never detects. This encounter results in Isobel's pregnancy.</p>

<h3 id='dionysius-silversleevesdionysius-silversleeves-1266html'><a href="characters/Dionysius-Silversleeves-1266.html">Dionysius Silversleeves</a></h3>

<p>Silversleeves is well-known at the Dog's Head as a relentless pursuer of prostitutes who visits regularly, "like a bad penny." On this night, Margery participates in the elaborate scheme to get him drunk and confused, then ultimately takes Joan's place in the darkness of the attic. Silversleeves mounts her believing she is Joan, and contracts syphilis from her. He later boasts publicly about the encounter, not realizing he was deceived. He experiences symptoms just after Christmas.</p>

<h3 id='martin-flemingmartin-fleming-1277html'><a href="characters/Martin-Fleming-1277.html">Martin Fleming</a></h3>

<p>Margery's connection to Martin is entirely through her efforts to help Joan save him. At the wedding, the priest "had never seen anything like it" - with Margery and Isobel as bridesmaids, and the remarkable detail that "young Martin Fleming was the only man in the church that day who had never slept with either of the Dogget sisters."</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Margery's life reflects several aspects of late 13th-century London's social and economic realities.</p>

<h3 id='the-liberty-of-the-clink-and-regulated-prostitution'>The Liberty of the Clink and Regulated Prostitution</h3>

<p>Margery works in the Liberty of the Clink, the Bishop of Winchester's feudal manor in Southwark containing eighteen licensed brothels. This area had been a place of prostitution since Saxon times, when brothels were called by their Old English name <i>horhus</i> (whorehouse). In the 1140s during Henry II's reign, the Bishop of Winchester (who was also Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket's superior) established comprehensive regulations for running the brothels "to the honour of God and according to the laudable customs and regulations of the land."</p>

<p>The system was remarkably well-organized. The bishop's bailiff inspected all prostitutes monthly, expelling any with disease. This thoroughness was considered one of the advantages of Church-run brothels. Prostitutes enjoyed some ecclesiastical privileges - they could receive communion - but faced restrictions such as burial in unconsecrated ground. London's own licensed brothels in Cock's Lane near St Bartholomew's followed the bishop's regulations, and prostitutes citywide were cheerfully called "Winchester Geese."</p>

<p>Margery's panic about her disease reflects the precariousness of her situation. Discovery meant immediate expulsion and loss of livelihood in a strictly regulated system that had no room for infected women.</p>

<h3 id='the-expulsion-of-the-jews-1290'>The Expulsion of the Jews (1290)</h3>

<p>Margery's wish that "the king hadn't thrown out all the Jews" reflects a recent and devastating change. In 1290, five years before the story, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Edward I</a> expelled the entire Jewish community from England. The expulsion came after generations of persecution, extortionate fines, and systematic financial ruin. Once the king had replaced Jewish financiers with Italian banking houses promoted by the Vatican, he no longer needed the Jewish community and expelled them in "an act of convenient piety."</p>

<p>The loss extended beyond finance to medicine. Jewish physicians had access to ancient knowledge from the classical world and Middle East, were better educated and less superstitious than many Christian doctors. The old Jewish doctor on Bankside had known how to treat syphilis with mercury. After the expulsion, Margery must settle for a Maiden Lane doctor who prescribes an ointment made primarily of goat urine.</p>

<p>This detail illustrates how Edward I's policies affected ordinary Londoners in unexpected ways, removing not just moneylenders but valuable medical expertise.</p>

<h3 id='social-mobility-and-family-decline'>Social Mobility and Family Decline</h3>

<p>The Dogget sisters' ancestry embodies the precariousness of status in medieval London. Their family descended from Adam Ducket, who lost London's freedom eighty years earlier due to association with the Barnikel rebellion. In his bitterness and pride, Adam refused help from the Barnikels and drifted to Southwark. Within one generation, a family of modest but respectable London citizens had sunk completely into the urban underclass.</p>

<p>Southwark, a borough independent of London across the river, served as a refuge for "vagrants and those in trouble with the law." The Dogget/Ducket family multiplied there - five siblings and a dozen cousins, all "cheerful, irrepressible, and disreputable." Some Duckets were embarrassed by the twins' fame and didn't mind the name transformation that distanced them. Margery and Isobel accepted the name "Dogget" cheerfully, demonstrating a lack of shame about their profession or status.</p>

<h3 id='womens-work-and-survival'>Women's Work and Survival</h3>

<p>Margery's occupation, while stigmatized, was also regulated, taxed, and tolerated as a necessary part of urban life. The elaborate ecclesiastical regulations governing Bankside brothels included specific rules about operations, customer rights, and working conditions. Prostitutes paid rent for their rooms and operated with some independence within the system.</p>

<p>The twins' ability to rent rooms, work together, set terms with customers (such as the "modest discount" for a party of three), and even take time off for pilgrimage shows they possessed more agency than might be expected. Their concern about Margery's disease centered not on moral judgment but on the practical matter of maintaining their livelihood within the system's health regulations.</p>

<h3 id='the-model-parliament-of-1295'>The Model Parliament of 1295</h3>

<p>The story takes place during the Parliament of 1295, often called the Model Parliament for its unusually broad representation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Edward I</a> summoned barons, knights, and burgesses to grant him taxes for his Scottish campaign. The Parliament's presence in Westminster provides the backdrop for several plot elements: the brothel is supposed to be closed for Parliament, though the brothelkeeper arranges discreet services; important men like Barnikel are in London for the proceedings; and ultimately it's this same Parliament where Barnikel makes his passionate, loyal speech that helps secure the generous tax grant.</p>

<p>The Parliament successfully concluded by Christmas, with barons and knights granting a tax of an eleventh of movable goods, clergy a tenth, and burgesses a seventh - demonstrating Edward I's ability to extract revenue for his campaigns.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<h3 id='sisterhood-and-female-solidarity'>Sisterhood and Female Solidarity</h3>

<p>Margery embodies one of the story's most powerful themes: the extraordinary bond between women, particularly sisters. The twins' relationship transcends mere family connection; they operate as a single entity with two bodies. Their ability to communicate through brief mutters, their perfect coordination in elaborate deceptions, and their mutual protection demonstrate a relationship of perfect trust and understanding.</p>

<p>More broadly, the sisters' immediate commitment to helping Joan - a complete stranger in desperate need - represents female solidarity across class and circumstance. Joan, daughter of a respectable craftsman, and the Dogget twins, working prostitutes, form an alliance that saves Martin Fleming's life. The prostitutes help preserve a respectable girl's virginity and reputation, while risking their own security.</p>

<p>Margery's ultimate sacrifice - taking Joan's place with Silversleeves despite her contagious disease - demonstrates that this solidarity extends to personal cost. She contracts syphilis to a man who will suffer for it, but does so to protect an innocent girl and fulfill her promise.</p>

<h3 id='ingenuity-and-agency'>Ingenuity and Agency</h3>

<p>Despite their low social status and limited options, Margery and Isobel demonstrate remarkable resourcefulness. When faced with Joan's seemingly impossible problem, they devise an ingenious scheme exploiting an obscure legal provision. When circumstances threaten that scheme, they adapt instantly with new plans - getting Silversleeves drunk, creating confusion in darkness, switching places with each other and with Joan.</p>

<p>The prostitutes prove more clever and capable than the men around them. Silversleeves, Bull, and Barnikel are all, to varying degrees, manipulated or deceived by the women's schemes. The twins use their indistinguishability as a weapon, their knowledge of customer preferences as leverage, and their coordination as an advantage.</p>

<p>This agency within powerlessness reflects a broader theme in the novel about how those at society's margins often possess greater practical intelligence and adaptability than their supposed betters.</p>

<h3 id='identity-and-interchangeability'>Identity and Interchangeability</h3>

<p>The fact that no one can distinguish Margery from Isobel drives much of the plot. Even their regular customer Barnikel, who specifically requests Margery, cannot tell he's actually sleeping with Isobel. This interchangeability allows for their most crucial deception.</p>

<p>But their indistinguishability also raises questions about identity and individuality. Are they truly the same person in two bodies? Their coordinated thinking, identical dress, and seamless substitution for each other suggest they deliberately cultivate their interchangeability as a survival strategy and source of power.</p>

<p>The revelation at the end - clarifying which sister slept with whom - matters greatly for the consequences (Isobel's pregnancy, Silversleeves's disease) but may not have mattered to the twins themselves. They share everything else; why not share identities?</p>

<h3 id='disease-and-vulnerability'>Disease and Vulnerability</h3>

<p>Margery's syphilis introduces a rare note of vulnerability into the twins' otherwise confident operation. The "burning sickness" threatens Margery's livelihood, her place in the only community that accepts her, and potentially her life. The monthly inspections create a regime of constant surveillance where one sore can mean expulsion.</p>

<p>Her decision to sleep with Silversleeves while infected is morally complex. She contracts the disease to him without his knowledge or consent - though he himself intended to force a supposed virgin who turned out to be equally nonconsenting. The text presents this as poetic justice when Silversleeves begins experiencing symptoms "just after Christmas," the consequence of his aggressive pursuit of women and his public boasting about an encounter that never happened as he imagined.</p>

<p>The disease also highlights the vulnerability of women in prostitution despite the regulations meant to protect public health. Margery's only recourse is a dubious doctor with goat-urine ointment, yet she has nowhere else to turn after the Jews' expulsion removed access to effective treatment.</p>

<h3 id='appearances-vs-reality'>Appearances vs. Reality</h3>

<p>The entire episode centers on the gap between appearance and reality. Joan appears to be a prostitute but is actually a virgin. The woman Silversleeves thinks he's sleeping with is actually a different woman. The woman Barnikel thinks he's sleeping with is actually her twin. The elaborate deception at the gallows - Joan's staged appearance as a prostitute, Bull and Silversleeves's testimony, the whole performance - is designed to seem like what it isn't.</p>

<p>Margery's role in these deceptions demonstrates how those whom society dismisses as morally compromised can act with greater honor than the respectable. Her promise to protect Joan is kept more faithfully than the Italian merchant's promises to Martin Fleming, more faithfully than the king's justice to Martin, more faithfully than many of the "respectable" characters manage.</p>

<h3 id='redemption-and-moral-complexity'>Redemption and Moral Complexity</h3>

<p>Despite being a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease who transmits it to an unwitting partner, Margery emerges as one of the story's moral heroes. She helps save an innocent man's life, preserves a respectable girl's virginity and reputation, and takes personal risks to keep her promises.</p>

<p>The chapter suggests that conventional morality - who is respectable, who is damned, who is pure - fails to capture actual virtue and vice. The prostitutes act with greater kindness and courage than many respectable characters. The Church runs the brothels while preaching against sin. The legal system nearly hangs an innocent man while the outcast women save him.</p>

<p>Margery's pilgrimage to Canterbury after the events suggests the possibility of redemption within the Church's framework, even for those it officially condemns to burial outside consecrated ground. Isobel explicitly believes "that God might forgive her sins in this harsh world and that, in the end, she would be saved." Margery's journey seems to affirm that hope.</p>
