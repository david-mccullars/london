<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Waldus Barnikel is a wealthy fishmonger who represents the rise of London's merchant class in the late thirteenth century. In 1295, at the height of his fortune and influence, he is appointed alderman for the Bulls' ward and summoned by King Edward I to attend Parliament. His success and elevation epitomize the displacement of London's old patrician families by ambitious, newly rich immigrants from East Anglia. His triumph over the Bull family, whom the Barnikels have hated for generations, provides him with immense satisfaction.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Waldus Barnikel is as round as a ball - as though nature, having decided to confine the towering strength and temper of his ancestors into a smaller space, realized that so much fermenting energy could only be contained, with any hope of avoiding an explosion, in a perfect and solidly constructed sphere. He is clean-shaven, though his red hair hangs halfway down his neck, and he wears a fur hat. He radiates confidence.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Waldus is characterized by boundless energy, confidence, and ambition. His physical roundness seems to contain the "fermenting energy" of his ancestors compressed into a spherical form. Despite his lower social origins compared to the patrician Bulls, he possesses a keen business sense and has successfully built his family's fishing enterprise into a substantial trading operation.</p>

<p>He is not a fool - he understands perfectly well that King Edward's summons to Parliament comes with strings attached, namely heavy taxation, yet he accepts this as the price of honour and influence. His habitual good humour reflects his contentment with his success in life. He describes himself as "the happiest man in London" on the day he meets with the king, and his "soul is soaked in honey" at the humiliation of the Bulls.</p>

<p>Waldus harbors a deep, ancestral hatred for the Bull family, which adds an extra dimension of sweetness to his political triumph when he is named alderman of their own ward, displacing their traditional authority. This hatred appears to be a long-standing family feud, as references are made to a young fishmonger named Barnikel (presumably an earlier relative) who once smashed the door of Bull's house and tried to set it on fire during the baronial rebellion.</p>

<p>He is a devoted widower who respected his late wife deeply. He pauses regularly at Charing Cross to say a prayer for her memory. Rather than remarry, he maintains a regular arrangement with one of the Dogget sisters at the Dog's Head brothel on Bankside, visiting once a week for nearly five years. This suggests both pragmatism and a certain loyalty to his wife's memory.</p>

<p>His willingness to intercede for Martin Fleming, a complete stranger, demonstrates that beneath his rough merchant exterior lies a capacity for compassion - though this is prompted by William Bull's extraordinary humbling of himself to ask for the fishmonger's help. Waldus understands what it cost the proud patrician to beg a favour from him and sees the opportunity to demonstrate his superiority over the fallen Bulls.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-marriage-c-1248-1290'>Early Life and Marriage (c. 1248-1290)</h3>

<p>Waldus was born around 1248 into the Barnikel family of fishmongers. By the time of his birth, the family had already begun their ascent to prosperity. His ancestors had acquired fishing vessels starting in the reign of King John, and by Waldus's youth, the family business had expanded substantially.</p>

<p>The family had established a second base of operations at Yarmouth, a busy port nearly a hundred miles away on the eastern coast, where they operated fishing vessels and held a half share in a profitable cargo ship. It was at Yarmouth that Waldus met and married a rich young heiress from Worsted, a descendant of seafaring Vikings like himself. This marriage doubled his fortune and brought her entire family to London with them.</p>

<p>Waldus and his wife had seven children together. She died in childbirth with an eighth child around 1290, on the day that King Edward erected Charing Cross as one of twelve monuments marking the resting places of Queen Eleanor's funeral cortège. Since that day, Waldus has never remarried but instead visits the Dog's Head brothel on Bankside once a week. He pauses at Charing Cross each time to say a prayer for his late wife.</p>

<h3 id='business-success-c-1270-1295'>Business Success (c. 1270-1295)</h3>

<p>Waldus continued to expand the family business beyond traditional fishmonger activities. While he still sold fish, his ships also carried furs and timber from the Baltic, grain, and even wine. The family maintained their warehouse at Billingsgate wharf and a huge stall in the market with six men behind the counter, as well as their profitable operations at Yarmouth.</p>

<p>His route to riches was typical of the successful fishmongers of his generation, who used their connections to the sea and trading networks to build substantial merchant operations. By 1295, Waldus was genuinely wealthy and no longer needed to be in awe of the Bulls' fortune.</p>

<h3 id='political-ascent-november-1295'>Political Ascent (November 1295)</h3>

<p>The pivotal moment in Waldus's life comes in November 1295. A year earlier, the post of alderman for the Bulls' own ward had fallen vacant. William Bull, scion of the old patrician family, had courted support from lesser merchants and craftsmen, made himself agreeable to the king's warden, and faced no challenger from within the ward. But when Bull presented himself at the Guildhall to be chosen, the Exchequer man curtly informed him that they had chosen someone else: Barnikel of Billingsgate, an outside man.</p>

<p>This appointment represented King Edward I's deliberate policy of breaking the power of London's old patrician oligarchy by promoting newly successful merchants and craftsmen. The king had dismissed the mayor, installed his own warden, and was systematically replacing the traditional aldermen with men who owed their positions to royal favour rather than ancient family privilege.</p>

<p>For Waldus, becoming alderman of the Bulls' own ward was a triumph beyond measure. The family that his ancestors had hated and fought against for generations was now displaced by a Barnikel. He wore the red robes of an alderman with pride, and all men now called him "Sire."</p>

<p>The day after his appointment, Waldus received a summons even more extraordinary: King Edward I personally requested his presence at Parliament. One of the London burgesses due to attend had fallen sick, and the king asked for Waldus by name to replace him. Though Waldus understood perfectly well that Edward wanted taxes from the merchants - and likely wanted a great deal - he was nonetheless deeply honoured. A Barnikel in Parliament!</p>

<p>When Waldus stood before the tall, grey-bearded monarch, Edward told him directly: "I need you for my parliament." The fishmonger blushed at the honour, though his shrewd mind noted the implications. Still, the king had asked for him by name. After meeting with Edward, Waldus proclaimed himself "the happiest man in London."</p>

<h3 id='the-fleming-pardon-november-1295'>The Fleming Pardon (November 1295)</h3>

<p>After his meeting with the king, Waldus rode to Bankside to celebrate at the Dog's Head, where he regularly slept with one of the Dogget sisters (always Margery, though he could not tell her from her identical twin Isobel). He had received word of a virgin at the brothel, a rare offering, and was eager to be first to claim her.</p>

<p>However, when he arrived, he discovered to his fury that <a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a> had already been with the girl. The thought of taking the girl after "that old fart" - the patrician he so despised - was unbearable to his pride. In his rage, he declared he wanted nothing to do with her and demanded one of the Dogget sisters instead, specifically Margery.</p>

<p>The girl in question was <a href="characters/Joan-Fleming-1280.html">Joan Fleming</a>, who was executing an elaborate plan to save her condemned lover <a href="characters/Martin-Fleming-1277.html">Martin Fleming</a> by becoming a prostitute and claiming him at the gallows. The following day, when Joan appeared at Newgate in the striped dress of a whore to claim Martin, the plan nearly failed when the young man, believing she had truly become a prostitute, refused to marry her and accept his pardon.</p>

<p>William Bull, who had given his word to help Joan, rode desperately to Westminster to seek a royal pardon. He was initially rejected by King Edward, who would not pardon a man who had robbed a Lombard moneylender. In desperation, Bull did something that must have cost him dearly: he rode to Waldus Barnikel and begged for his help.</p>

<p>Waldus immediately understood what it had cost the proud patrician to come begging to him. Though he had no particular interest in Fleming, he knew this was an opportunity to demonstrate his own triumph over the fallen Bulls. He agreed to help.</p>

<p>When Waldus stood before King Edward a second time to request the pardon, the monarch was astonished that another man was begging for Fleming's life. Edward asked directly: "You are asking a favour from me already, are you, Alderman Barnikel? You know that the favours even of kings usually come at a price?" Waldus nodded and agreed without hesitation. The king smiled and remarked that they had a busy Parliament ahead, adding meaningfully: "Remember, Alderman Barnikel, that I shall be relying on you."</p>

<p>A royal clerk rode with Waldus and Bull to Smithfield, where they arrived just as Martin Fleming stood with a noose around his neck. The royal pardon saved the young man's life.</p>

<p>A few days later, at the wedding of Martin and Joan Fleming at St Mary Overy in Southwark, Waldus stood by Martin as the groom's supporter while Bull gave the bride away - an extraordinary scene in which two men who had been enemies for generations united to support a couple whose families had abandoned them.</p>

<h3 id='parliament-and-its-consequences-december-1295'>Parliament and Its Consequences (December 1295)</h3>

<p>The Parliament of 1295, often called the Model Parliament because of its broad composition, concluded its business by Christmas. The barons and knights granted King Edward a tax of an eleventh of their movable goods, the clergy a tenth, and the burgesses - no doubt stirred by a passionate and loyal speech from Alderman Barnikel - a generous seventh.</p>

<p>Waldus had kept his word to the king, and Edward had received the taxes he desired. The price of royal favour had been paid.</p>

<p>Around the same time, it became apparent that one of the Dogget sisters (<a href="characters/Isobel-Dogget-1270.html">Isobel Dogget</a>) was pregnant, and she was certain the father was Waldus. This would give the alderman an eighth child, though whether he acknowledged this child or provided support is not recorded.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='william-bull'>William Bull</h3>

<p>Waldus's relationship with <a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a> embodies a generations-long family feud between the Barnikels and the Bulls. The Bulls represented London's old patrician oligarchy, wealthy merchant families who had controlled the city's government for centuries. The Barnikels were originally more humble fishmongers who gradually built their wealth and resented the Bulls' superior status.</p>

<p>The enmity went back decades. During the baronial rebellion led by Simon de Montfort in the previous generation, a young fishmonger named Barnikel had led a riot that smashed the door of Bull's house and tried to burn it down. The radical commoners briefly deposed the aldermen and elected their own men, before the old patriciate regained control.</p>

<p>By 1295, the tables had turned decisively. King Edward I, who disliked the proud patrician aldermen, had systematically undermined their power. When Bull sought to become alderman of his own ward, the king's warden appointed Waldus instead - an outside man from Billingsgate, deliberately chosen to humiliate the Bulls. For Waldus, this was a triumph that made his "soul soaked in honey."</p>

<p>The rivalry reached its climax on the day Waldus met with King Edward and was summoned to Parliament. Afterward, he went to the Dog's Head to celebrate, only to discover that Bull had already been with the virgin he had been promised. Waldus was "puce with rage" at finding Bull had gotten there first. The thought of following "that old fart" was unbearable.</p>

<p>Yet the next day, this ancient enmity was transformed by an extraordinary act. Bull came to Waldus, humbled himself, and begged for help in saving Martin Fleming's life. Waldus immediately recognized what this cost the proud patrician and saw an opportunity to demonstrate his complete triumph. He agreed to help, knowing it would show that even Bulls now came begging to Barnikels.</p>

<p>Both men rode to Smithfield with the royal pardon, and days later stood together at the Fleming wedding - Waldus as groomsman, Bull giving away the bride. The ancient feud did not end, but it was set aside, at least temporarily, in service of saving a life.</p>

<h3 id='king-edward-i'>King Edward I</h3>

<p>Waldus's relationship with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Edward I</a> represents the king's deliberate policy of breaking the power of London's patrician families by promoting newly successful merchants. Edward appointed Waldus as alderman specifically to humiliate William Bull and his class, and summoned him to Parliament to extract taxes from the merchant community.</p>

<p>Waldus understood the transactional nature of royal favour. He knew Edward wanted taxes and was flattering him to get them. "If the king wanted merchants at this Parliament, it meant he wanted taxes from the towns. If he was ready to flatter a newly made alderman, he must want a lot." Yet despite this clear-eyed understanding, Waldus was genuinely honoured by the king's attention.</p>

<p>When Waldus returned to Edward to ask for Martin Fleming's pardon, the king pointedly reminded him that favours come at a price and that he would be "relying on" Waldus in Parliament. The alderman agreed without hesitation, and at the Parliament's conclusion, the burgesses voted a generous seventh of their movable goods in taxes - likely prompted by Waldus's passionate advocacy. This completed the exchange: royal favour for loyal service and substantial taxation.</p>

<h3 id='the-dogget-sisters'>The Dogget Sisters</h3>

<p>Waldus maintained a regular arrangement with the Dogget sisters at the Dog's Head, visiting once a week for nearly five years. He "always" slept with one particular sister, though he could not tell Margery from Isobel (they were identical twins). He believed he always chose Margery.</p>

<p>This arrangement represented Waldus's solution to widowhood. Having deeply respected his late wife and having seven children to remember her by, he chose not to remarry. Instead, he maintained this pragmatic weekly arrangement that satisfied his physical needs without the complications of a new marriage.</p>

<p>The relationship was apparently cordial and regular rather than passionate. When Waldus demanded "the Dogget girl" on the day of his triumph, it was matter-of-fact rather than lustful. He even planned to give her a present to keep her happy.</p>

<p>Unknown to Waldus, on the chaotic night when he believed he slept with Margery after being denied the virgin Joan, he actually slept with Isobel in the darkness. By Christmas, Isobel was certain she was pregnant with his child. Whether Waldus ever learned the truth about this deception, or acknowledged the child, is not recorded.</p>

<h3 id='martin-and-joan-fleming'>Martin and Joan Fleming</h3>

<p>Waldus had no connection to <a href="characters/Martin-Fleming-1277.html">Martin Fleming</a> or <a href="characters/Joan-Fleming-1280.html">Joan Fleming</a> before the day of Martin's scheduled execution. He agreed to help them solely because William Bull humbled himself to ask for Waldus's intercession. The fishmonger saw an opportunity to demonstrate his superiority over the Bulls while also doing a genuinely good deed.</p>

<p>At the wedding, Waldus stood by Martin as groomsman - an extraordinary gesture given that Martin's own family had abandoned him and that Waldus was a powerful alderman supporting a poor craftsman accused of theft. This act suggests that underneath his rough merchant exterior and his delight in political triumph, Waldus possessed a capacity for generosity and compassion.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Waldus Barnikel represents a crucial transition in London's power structure during the late thirteenth century. The city was experiencing a massive influx of immigrants, particularly from East Anglia, where the wool and cloth trade had created substantial new wealth. These merchants from the Danelaw brought with them Viking traditions of independent seafaring commerce and gradually displaced the old patrician families who had controlled London since the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>King Edward I deliberately accelerated this process. Having seen his father and grandfather humiliated by baronial councils, Edward was determined to break any power that might challenge his authority. The proud aldermen of London, who elected their own mayor and claimed ancient privileges, were prime targets. Edward dismissed the mayor, installed his own warden, reformed the city's laws and courts, and systematically replaced patrician aldermen with new men who owed everything to royal favour.</p>

<p>The appointment of Waldus as alderman of the Bulls' own ward exemplifies this policy. It was a calculated insult to the old guard, demonstrating that wealth and royal favour now mattered more than ancient family lineage. The patricians were in full retreat - William Bull would soon abandon London entirely and retire to his country estates.</p>

<p>Edward's use of Parliament served similar purposes. By summoning not just barons but also knights and burgesses, he created a broader base of support for his policies while also limiting the power of the feudal magnates. The 1295 Parliament, often called the Model Parliament, was a sophisticated exercise in political management: the king appeared to seek advice while actually strengthening his own authority and extracting substantial taxes.</p>

<p>The incident involving Martin Fleming's pardon illuminates how justice worked in this period. Royal pardons were available but usually only to those who could pay or who had powerful connections. A poor craftsman like Martin would ordinarily have no hope, which makes the intervention by two of London's most powerful men all the more remarkable. The king's initial refusal based on protecting his "foreign merchants" (the Italian Lombards) reflects the pragmatic economic policies that made Edward such an effective monarch.</p>

<p>Waldus's weekly visits to Bankside reflect the institutionalized nature of prostitution in medieval London. The Bishop of Winchester ran the Southwark brothels under careful regulations, with regular health inspections. Edward understood that Parliament and prostitution went together - when burgesses and knights gathered in Westminster, the Bankside brothels officially closed but discreetly continued operations. This was accepted as simple reality, not scandalous hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The expulsion of the Jews in 1290, mentioned in the chapter, had created opportunities for Christian moneylenders, particularly the Italian Lombards who dominated Lombard Street. Edward's fierce protection of these Lombards demonstrated how royal policy favoured merchants who were useful to the crown, while Jews, having been bled dry by royal fines, were simply expelled.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Waldus Barnikel embodies the theme of social mobility and the displacement of old elites by new wealth. His triumph over the Bulls represents a fundamental shift in London's power structure from ancient lineage to commercial success and royal favour. The fact that his happiness comes not just from wealth but specifically from humiliating the Bulls shows how social hierarchies were being violently renegotiated in this period.</p>

<p>The character illustrates how King Edward I's political genius lay in identifying and empowering men like Waldus - ambitious, capable, and entirely dependent on royal favour for their elevated status. Edward created a new class of officials and aldermen who had every reason to support strong royal authority, since that authority was the source of their power. Waldus understands the transactional nature of this relationship but embraces it anyway, knowing that his own interests align with the king's.</p>

<p>Waldus's ancestral hatred of the Bulls, going back generations, reflects how medieval social conflicts were long-lasting and deeply personal. Feuds between families could persist for centuries, with each generation inheriting both the wealth and the animosities of their ancestors. The fact that Waldus can set this aside, at least temporarily, to help save Martin Fleming's life suggests that newer values (compassion, justice, or at least the satisfaction of demonstrating superiority through magnanimity) were beginning to compete with ancient hatreds.</p>

<p>His marriage to a woman from Worsted and the influx of her family represents the broader pattern of East Anglian migration to London. These descendants of Angles and Danes were, in a sense, returning to claim the city that their ancestors had held before the Norman Conquest. The book notes that "the Norsemen were coming to London again, not as Viking seafarers, but as their solid, middle-class descendants." This represents continuity across centuries, as the Danish character of London reasserts itself over Norman-French patrician culture.</p>

<p>Waldus's devotion to his late wife's memory, demonstrated by his regular prayers at Charing Cross, humanizes a character who might otherwise seem merely a triumphant vulgarian. His choice to remain a widower and maintain a practical arrangement with the brothel rather than remarry suggests both genuine love for his wife and a pragmatic acceptance of human needs. This combination of sentiment and practicality characterizes the merchant class.</p>

<p>The fishmonger's role in saving Martin Fleming demonstrates how power, once achieved, can be used for good or ill. Waldus could have refused Bull's plea or demanded some price for his help, but instead he saw an opportunity to demonstrate his superiority through generosity. His standing at Martin's wedding as groomsman, when the young man's own family had abandoned him, shows that the new merchant class could be more generous than the old patricians in some ways - perhaps because they remembered their own relatively recent rise from humbler status.</p>
