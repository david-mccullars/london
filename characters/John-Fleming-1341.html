<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>John Fleming is a modest grocer in fourteenth-century London, a member of the powerful Grocers Guild who operates a small stall in the West Cheap. Despite his humble nature and spindly appearance, he marries the formidable Dame Barnikel, widow of a tavern-keeper. His tragedy unfolds when, desperate to prove himself worthy of his wife and provide for his daughter, he becomes the victim of an elaborate alchemical fraud that costs him his life savings and ultimately drives him to suicide.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Fleming has a distinctive "spoon-like face" and a "thin, concave face" with a "spindly body." He is noticeably smaller than his wife Dame Barnikel, who stands half a head taller than him. His physical appearance is so unimpressive that people who see him and Dame Barnikel together "could never believe they were man and wife" and "never thought he could stay the course."</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Fleming is quiet, modest, and scrupulous in his business dealings. Of all the members of the Grocers Guild, "few were more modest than John Fleming." He is meticulous about weighing items accurately and has never been taken to the Pie-Powder court for dishonest trading. He takes pride in stating, "I've never been taken to the Pie-Powder court in my life" and has "never sold short measure by so much as a grain."</p>

<p>His personality is marked by a profound sense of shame and an acute fear of public disgrace. When shown a merchant being punished in the stocks, he remarks quietly, "If they'd done that to me, I would have died" – words that prove prophetic. Though he possesses no books of his own and struggles with Latin or French, he has "a fascination with all forms of learning" and seeks out educated men to engage them in conversation.</p>

<p>Fleming is a dreamer with an inferiority complex. He yearns to impress his magnificent wife and provide better for his daughter, imagining a life where he could "buy the George, the Tabard, every inn from Southwark to Rochester." He desires that Dame Barnikel would "bless him, love him, even respect him as other wives did their husbands." This desperate need for validation makes him vulnerable to the fraudulent promises of alchemy.</p>

<p>His most tragic flaw is his overwhelming sense of shame, which proves stronger than his will to live. He is fundamentally decent and well-meaning, but his combination of ambition, insecurity, and fear of disgrace proves fatal.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='c-1341-birth-and-early-life'>c. 1341: Birth and Early Life</h3>

<p>Fleming is born into the Fleming family, descended from the boy rescued by the saddle painter's daughter eight decades earlier. The family has connections to various craft families including the Painters and Carpenters.</p>

<h3 id='c-1362-1370-marriage-to-dame-barnikel'>c. 1362-1370: Marriage to Dame Barnikel</h3>

<p>At some point before 1370, Fleming, working as a grocer, marries Dame Barnikel, who had been widowed at age sixteen after her first marriage to a tavern-keeper. The marriage is a source of wonder to those who know them – not only because of the stark physical contrast but because Dame Barnikel, at thirty, is "magnificent" with dark red hair and a booming voice, while Fleming is quiet and unimpressive. "Why, only a year after first being widowed, she had married this quiet grocer, it remained one of the mysteries in an otherwise ordered universe."</p>

<p>Despite the apparent mismatch, Fleming respects his wife's business acumen. She runs the George Inn independently while he operates his grocery business. When city beadles complain about Dame Barnikel's flagrant violations of sumptuary laws, "the grocer only shrugged and suggested: 'You talk to her.' At which the beadle would hurriedly leave."</p>

<h3 id='c-1365-fatherhood'>c. 1365: Fatherhood</h3>

<p>His daughter Amy is born. She inherits his thin, concave face and silent disposition, though she is more strongly built.</p>

<h3 id='1370s-business-operations'>1370s: Business Operations</h3>

<p>Fleming operates a modest grocery business with his apprentice <a href="characters/Geoffrey-Ducket-1361.html">Geoffrey Ducket</a>. He has "a little stall in the West Cheap, by Honey Lane, though he kept his goods in a storehouse behind the George." Every morning, he and Ducket leave Southwark and push their brightly painted handcart across London Bridge to set up their stall. They sell cheese, eggs, salt, dried fruit, and most importantly, black peppercorns from Venice, which Fleming calls "the grocer's gold dust, young Geoffrey Ducket. Purest gold."</p>

<p>Fleming is scrupulous in his trading, weighing every item with utmost care. He takes pride in his honesty and has never been found guilty of short measure. He explains the importance of reputation to his apprentice by showing him merchants being punished in the stocks, remarking on the devastating power of shame.</p>

<p>In the evenings, Fleming frequents the George Inn, seeking out educated men to engage in learned conversations. Though he owns no books and struggles with Latin and French, he has an intense "fascination with all forms of learning."</p>

<h3 id='c-1377-introduction-to-benedict-silversleeves'>c. 1377: Introduction to Benedict Silversleeves</h3>

<p>One evening when Fleming seems particularly depressed, Ducket introduces him to <a href="characters/Benedict-Silversleeves-1352.html">Benedict Silversleeves</a>, a young lawyer recently returned from Rochester. The two men engage in deep conversation about abstruse matters, and Fleming's "thin face" shows "a look of delight" at finding "a man of education."</p>

<p>This encounter proves fateful. Silversleeves, a practitioner of fraudulent alchemy, identifies Fleming as a potential victim – a man desperate to prove himself, with savings to exploit, and too ashamed to expose the fraud once he realizes the truth.</p>

<h3 id='1377-1382-the-alchemical-deception'>1377-1382: The Alchemical Deception</h3>

<p>Fleming becomes secretly involved in Benedict Silversleeves's alchemical experiments. Believing he has found "the secret of the universe," he begins meeting Silversleeves in a house in Chancery Lane, attending sessions where the lawyer, dressed in a black robe sewn with golden images of the sun, moon, and planets, performs elaborate rituals claiming to transmute base metals into silver and gold.</p>

<p>The fraud is sophisticated. Silversleeves uses a hollow stick filled with granules of silver, which melt out when the stick is used to stir a crucible. Fleming witnesses what appears to be base metals transforming into precious ones. "Most of the charlatans who practised this criminal activity would explain their failure by some defect in the equipment, or in the ingredients supplied. Silversleeves, however, had a more elegant solution" – claiming that the final transition to gold requires perfect planetary alignment.</p>

<p>Fleming becomes obsessed, attending sessions perhaps once every ten days. He is found with "his eyes bloodshot and his hand bandaged from a severe burn" after one session, muttering about "an accident" but refusing to explain. He watches the experiments "spellbound, his concave face turned towards the glowing coals in the fire."</p>

<p>In his dreams, he imagines the wealth alchemy will bring: "Why, he could buy the George, the Tabard, every inn from Southwark to Rochester and on to Canterbury too. Dame Barnikel could do as she pleased. He would give her all the furs and gorgeous clothes that she wanted. How she would bless him, love him, even respect him as other wives did their husbands. And Amy should marry a gentleman."</p>

<p>He systematically drains his savings buying more of Silversleeves's magical powder, paying for each new batch of "Elixir" that promises to complete the transformation. The deception is so complete that Fleming stands in his storehouse at night, holding precious peppercorns in his cupped hands and declaring them "worthless" compared to the secret of the universe he believes he has discovered.</p>

<h3 id='1380-the-poll-tax-crisis'>1380: The Poll Tax Crisis</h3>

<p>When poll tax collectors arrive at the George, Fleming shocks everyone by confessing, "I can't pay. I've no money." He goes to his strongbox and returns with only half a mark. Dame Barnikel is "beside herself" with fury and suspicion. <a href="characters/Gilbert-Bull-1330.html">Gilbert Bull</a> later tells his daughter that "Dame Barnikel thinks there's been a theft and that Fleming may be protecting the boy" – meaning Ducket.</p>

<p>This suspicion hangs over the household for months, poisoning relationships. Fleming bears the shame in silence, unable to confess his foolishness and unwilling to expose Silversleeves's fraud because of his own complicity.</p>

<h3 id='may-1382-discovery-and-earthquake'>May 1382: Discovery and Earthquake</h3>

<p>On a wet spring night in May, Ducket follows Fleming to Chancery Lane and discovers him in a house with Silversleeves, dressed in his alchemist's robes, conducting another experiment. At the climactic moment, an earthquake strikes London – one of the very few recorded in the city's history. The house shakes violently, bowls and beakers tremble, and Fleming cries out in ecstasy: "Dear God, this is it!" He believes the universe itself is responding to their successful transmutation.</p>

<p>The earthquake causes Ducket to burst through the door unexpectedly. He sees "Fleming, staring as if he were a ghost, and by the fire a magician. Yet not a magician" – but Silversleeves, whose face is "a picture of embarrassment and guilt." Fleming, still believing in the magic, tells Ducket with "angelic happiness": "Oh Ducket, come and see. We have just made gold."</p>

<p>Ducket, who knows about alchemical frauds, turns on Silversleeves: "You devil." He forces the lawyer to confess the truth to Fleming. The revelation devastates the grocer: "He has stolen all my money then."</p>

<h3 id='may-june-1382-suicide'>May-June 1382: Suicide</h3>

<p>When Ducket threatens to expose Silversleeves, Fleming pleads with him through tears: "I've always been good to you, Ducket. So promise me, you'll never tell a soul what I have done. If my wife and Amy ever knew... I couldn't bear that, Ducket. Will you promise me?" He hangs his head in shame.</p>

<p>The next morning, Fleming appears subdued but business continues. However, behind the scenes, Silversleeves has betrayed Ducket to discredit him, ensuring that any accusation against the lawyer will be dismissed as malice.</p>

<p>Alone in the storehouse at exactly noon, Fleming writes a brief letter taking responsibility for the missing money and requesting that Ducket take over his business. He describes Ducket as "a good friend to me, and very loyal. He tried to save me but it's too late. You can trust him."</p>

<p>The letter reads:</p>
<p>"I am sorry about the Poll Tax money, and all the other money too. It was me that stole it. I was trying to make more for you and Amy. Please don't ask any more.</p>
<p>I want young Ducket to take over the business. He has been a good friend to me, and very loyal. He tried to save me but it's too late. You can trust him."</p>

<p>That evening, when Dame Barnikel and Ducket try to enter the storehouse, they find Fleming "hanging by a rope he had tied to a rafter." He has taken his own life, unable to bear the shame of his foolishness and failure.</p>

<p>When Ducket tells Dame Barnikel he promised Fleming never to reveal the full truth, she accepts this: "He didn't really mean to" steal, Ducket explains. Dame Barnikel remarks, "He didn't have to do this," but Ducket understands that "the rope around poor Fleming's neck was the visible cause" but "in truth his sad little master had died of shame."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='dame-barnikel'>Dame Barnikel</h3>

<p>Fleming's relationship with his wife is the central tension of his life. Their marriage is "one of the mysteries in an otherwise ordered universe" – a quiet, unimpressive grocer married to a magnificent, forceful woman who towers over him physically and socially. Dame Barnikel retains her birth name rather than becoming known as "Dame Fleming," reflecting her dominant personality.</p>

<p>Despite the apparent mismatch, Fleming respects his wife's independence and business acumen. He allows her complete control of the George Inn and never interferes: "He has his business and I have mine," Dame Barnikel explains. When city officials complain about her violations of sumptuary laws, Fleming simply tells them to speak to her directly, knowing they will back down.</p>

<p>However, Fleming harbors deep insecurity about earning Dame Barnikel's respect and love. He dreams that when the alchemy succeeds, "Dame Barnikel could do as she pleased. He would give her all the furs and gorgeous clothes that she wanted. How she would bless him, love him, even respect him as other wives did their husbands." This desperate need for her approval drives his tragic decisions.</p>

<p>Dame Barnikel, for her part, initially suspects Fleming of protecting Ducket when money goes missing. After Fleming's death, she reflects that she had not "been able to make much of poor Fleming," suggesting both affection and resignation about their marriage.</p>

<h3 id='amy-fleming'>Amy Fleming</h3>

<p>Fleming cares deeply for his daughter, who has inherited his thin, concave face and quiet nature. His dreams of alchemical wealth include ensuring "Amy should marry a gentleman. Or, if she preferred, Carpenter." He supports Amy's relationship with <a href="characters/Ben-Carpenter-1362.html">Ben Carpenter</a>, even though Dame Barnikel considers the craftsman beneath their daughter. Fleming's taking a liking to the "solemn craftsman" is enough to restrain Dame Barnikel from dismissing him outright.</p>

<p>His final letter expresses concern for Amy's future, apologizing for the missing money that was meant for her: "I was trying to make more for you and Amy."</p>

<h3 id='geoffrey-ducket'>Geoffrey Ducket</h3>

<p>Fleming is a good master to his apprentice Geoffrey Ducket. He trains him carefully in the grocery trade, teaching him both scrupulous business practices and the value of different commodities. Their daily routine of pushing the handcart across London Bridge together creates a bond between them.</p>

<p>Fleming appreciates Ducket's company and values his loyalty. In the evenings at the George, Ducket sometimes helps his master find educated men to converse with, as when he introduces Fleming to Silversleeves. Fleming trusts Ducket enough to reveal his alchemical activities during a moment of ecstasy, showing him the storehouse and declaring, "Isn't this a fine place?"</p>

<p>When the fraud is discovered, Fleming appeals to Ducket's loyalty: "I've always been good to you, Ducket. So promise me, you'll never tell a soul what I have done." His final act is to write a letter endorsing Ducket as his successor: "I want young Ducket to take over the business. He has been a good friend to me, and very loyal. He tried to save me but it's too late. You can trust him."</p>

<p>Ducket honors this trust even after Fleming's death, telling Dame Barnikel, "I promised him I'd never tell" the full story of what happened.</p>

<h3 id='benedict-silversleeves'>Benedict Silversleeves</h3>

<p>Fleming's relationship with Silversleeves is that of victim and predator, though Fleming never fully understands this. He is initially delighted to find such an educated man willing to converse with him, experiencing "a look of delight" at their first meeting. When Silversleeves introduces him to alchemy, Fleming becomes "spellbound," attending sessions in Chancery Lane where he watches the supposed transmutations with mounting excitement.</p>

<p>Fleming is "only one of a number of clients – each of whom believed that he alone shared the secret – who were greatly in awe of" Silversleeves. He systematically hands over his savings to purchase more of the alchemist's powder, believing each new batch brings him closer to transforming base metals into gold.</p>

<p>Even after Ducket exposes the fraud, Fleming's response is not anger but shame and a desperate plea to keep the matter secret. His fear of Dame Barnikel and Amy learning of his foolishness outweighs any desire for justice against Silversleeves.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>John Fleming lives during one of the most turbulent periods in medieval English history. As a grocer, he is part of a powerful guild that had recently been formed by the merger of the ancient Pepperers Company with general wholesalers known as "grossers." The new Grocers Guild is described as "large and powerful" and vying "with the Fishmongers" and "the Wool and Cloth Guilds for the city's greatest offices."</p>

<p>His life spans the reign of Edward III (died 1377) and the early years of Richard II. He witnesses the decline of royal authority during the boy king's minority and experiences the tensions between London and the royal court. When John of Gaunt and other nobles boycott London's markets in retaliation for the city's political independence, Fleming and other traders suffer severely: "All the grocers are hit, and the fishmongers and butchers even more."</p>

<p>The Poll Tax of 1380, which Fleming cannot pay due to his losses to Silversleeves, represents the desperate financial measures of a government struggling with the costs of the Hundred Years' War. The tax's impact on Fleming's household foreshadows its broader role in triggering the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. During the revolt, Fleming's world is disrupted as Tyler's forces cross London Bridge and camp at Smithfield, though he and Ducket manage to continue some business operations.</p>

<p>Fleming's vulnerability to alchemical fraud reflects the medieval worldview that blended what we would now distinguish as science, magic, and religion. Alchemy was widely practiced and taken seriously even by educated men. The idea that base metals could be transmuted into gold through the right combination of elements and celestial alignment seemed plausible in an era when the fundamental nature of matter was not understood. Fleming's fascination with learning and his inability to read Latin or French make him particularly susceptible – he can be impressed by Silversleeves's apparent knowledge without being able to verify it through books or other scholars.</p>

<p>The earthquake of May 1382 that coincides with Fleming's final alchemical session was a real event, "one of the very few recorded in London's history." Medieval Londoners, who had never experienced such a phenomenon, interpreted it with fear and sought spiritual explanations. For Fleming, it seems like cosmic confirmation of the transmutation.</p>

<p>His suicide reflects both personal shame and the medieval understanding of honor. In a society where reputation was essential for business and social standing, public disgrace could be genuinely unbearable. Fleming's fear that he would "die" if placed in the stocks proves prophetic – shame is more powerful than his will to live.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>John Fleming embodies the tragedy of the well-meaning dreamer destroyed by his own insecurities. His story explores the gap between ambition and ability, and the devastating power of shame. He is scrupulously honest in his daily business but becomes complicit in fraud through his desperate desire for transformation. His modest success as a grocer is not enough – he yearns to be worthy of his magnificent wife and to provide his daughter with a better life.</p>

<p>His vulnerability to Silversleeves's fraud illustrates how shame can trap its victims. Once Fleming has invested in the alchemical scheme, he cannot expose the fraud without exposing his own foolishness. This keeps him paying more and more, hoping that the next experiment will finally succeed and redeem his earlier losses. When the fraud is revealed, his immediate response is not anger at Silversleeves but terror that Dame Barnikel and Amy might learn of his gullibility.</p>

<p>Fleming represents the medieval petty bourgeoisie's precarious position – comfortable enough to have savings, but without the education, connections, or confidence of the truly powerful. His fascination with learned men and his inability to access learning directly make him vulnerable to those who can manipulate specialized knowledge.</p>

<p>His suicide speaks to the overwhelming power of shame in medieval society, where reputation was essential for survival. For Fleming, the fear of public disgrace proves more powerful than family bonds or the will to live. His death indirectly brings about positive change – it clears Ducket of suspicion, leads to Ducket taking over the business, and Fleming's endorsement of the apprentice influences Amy's eventual choice of husband. But this positive outcome emerges from a personal tragedy: a fundamentally decent man destroyed by forces he could not understand or control.</p>

<p>The timing of his suicide just before Ducket needs his testimony to save Tiffany from Silversleeves adds poignancy to his story. Had Fleming lived a few more days, he might have found purpose in protecting another victim of the man who destroyed him. Instead, his final service to Ducket is his written endorsement, and his death removes the one witness who could have exposed Silversleeves's crimes.</p>

<p>Fleming's story also highlights the complex relationship between knowledge and power in medieval London. Education and learning were sources of authority, but they could also be used to exploit the less educated. Silversleeves's command of Latin, his understanding of alchemical texts, and his ability to speak the language of learning give him power over Fleming, who yearns for knowledge but cannot access it directly. The grocer who meticulously weighs peppercorns to ensure fair measure is undone by his inability to weigh the claims of a fraudulent scholar.</p>
