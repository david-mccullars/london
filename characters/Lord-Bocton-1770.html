<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Lord Bocton is the conservative, penny-pinching heir to the sporting and radical Earl of St James. A rigid Tory who fears revolution and "the people," he undergoes an ironic political transformation when circumstances lead him to champion parliamentary reform. His defining characteristic is his strained relationship with his flamboyant father, whom he attempts to have declared insane and committed to Bedlam in order to secure his inheritance. Despite his cold exterior and mercenary motivations, Bocton proves himself capable of political pragmatism and ultimately votes for the historic Reform Bill of 1831-32.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Lord Bocton is tall and thin like his mother's family, a stark contrast to his father. He has a white flash in his dark hair, like his father, but that is where the physical similarities end. He dresses in an old-fashioned, conservative style: silk stockings and silver buckled shoes fashionable twenty years before 1819, a black, buttoned-up waistcoat, a stiff white collar, and a coat that is always dark green. His father remarks with perfect truth: "You look like a bottle." His appearance reflects his personality—rigid, traditional, and utterly opposed to his father's flamboyant Regency buck style.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Lord Bocton is characterized by his conservatism, caution, and mercenary nature. He is a Tory who fears revolution and believes that "the people" represent a terrifying, lawless mob, carrying in his mind historical memories dating back to Wat Tyler's revolt and the Gordon Riots. Unlike his father, he does not bet, does not embrace risk, and counts every penny of the family fortune.</p>

<p>His defining trait is his strained relationship with his father, driven primarily by money. He resents his father's radical politics, his extravagant spending, and most of all, his longevity. Bocton's impatience for his inheritance drives him to conspire with Cornelius Silversleeves, deputy superintendent of Bedlam, to have his father declared insane and committed. This scheme reveals both his ruthlessness and his calculating nature.</p>

<p>Despite his cold, bottle-like exterior, Bocton proves capable of political calculation and pragmatism. When Catholic Emancipation threatens to strengthen the Whigs, he cynically switches his position to support reform, understanding that political survival sometimes requires ideological flexibility. His transformation from die-hard Tory to reform supporter demonstrates not a change of heart but rather a shrewd assessment of political necessity.</p>

<p>Bocton represents the anxious conservative aristocracy of early 19th-century England—men who feared change, clung to old ways, yet ultimately had to adapt to survive in a transforming political landscape.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1819-political-opposition-and-the-conspiracy-begins'>1819: Political Opposition and the Conspiracy Begins</h3>

<p>In 1819, Lord Bocton appears at his father's Fitzroy Square house following Zachary Carpenter's inflammatory speech advocating for the Rights of Man and parliamentary reform. He is accompanied by Cornelius Silversleeves, deputy superintendent of Bedlam. Bocton openly criticizes his father for hosting such dangerous radical politics and fears the speech will provoke a riot, especially in the tense atmosphere following the Peterloo Massacre.</p>

<p>The encounter reveals the deep philosophical and personal divide between father and son. The Earl of St James openly mocks Bocton in front of Carpenter, suggesting his son wishes him dead in order to inherit, and gleefully announces plans to build an expensive new house in Regent's Park. When Bocton suggests his father is "a little old" for such a move, the earl declares he will "live to be a hundred" and that Bocton will be over seventy by then.</p>

<p>After leaving his father's house, Bocton discusses his conspiracy with Silversleeves. The deputy superintendent outlines his theory that the earl's radical politics represent developing madness: "a man gets an idea, it grows, finally it gets him. From enthusiasm to obsession; from obsession to lunacy." When Bocton bluntly asks if Silversleeves can lock his father up, the answer is: "Oh, I'm sure of it, my lord. Sooner or later."</p>

<p>Later that year, when the Earl of St James refuses to pay the parish rates for the new St Pancras church (which Carpenter had protested as monstrous taxation), Bocton sees his opportunity. He tells Silversleeves: "We'll let them arrest him first. Then we'll save him." The plan is to use the arrest as evidence of the earl's madness.</p>

<p>However, the scheme is foiled when an unknown person (actually <a href="characters/Eugene-Penny-1801.html">Eugene Penny</a>, acting on behalf of Meredith and George de Quette) secretly pays the rates. When Bocton and Silversleeves chase down Eugene and demand his name, he responds with delicious puzzlement: "My name? Why, sir, that's strange. I can't remember." Silversleeves remarks that inability to remember one's own name is "a sure sign of insanity," to which Bocton cries in frustration: "Oh damn your insanity!"</p>

<h3 id='1829-the-reform-campaign'>1829: The Reform Campaign</h3>

<p>By 1829, Lord Bocton has undergone a dramatic political transformation—he approaches his old enemy Zachary Carpenter and announces he is standing for Parliament on a platform of reform. Carpenter is initially suspicious of this sudden conversion, but Bocton carefully explains his position.</p>

<p>Bocton acknowledges that the system of representation—with its rotten boroughs and pocket boroughs—is hard to defend. However, his support for reform has calculated limits. He rejects the secret ballot as "a cowardly underhand sort of method which no honest man should support." More importantly, when Carpenter hesitates over whether everyone should vote, Bocton presses the point: should "the journeyman you have to dismiss for drunkenness, the apprentice, the beggar in the workhouse" have the same right to elect governors? They agree that "men who pay taxes should vote"—solid citizens, men like Carpenter. Property owners.</p>

<p>Bocton reveals his true motivation for supporting reform: Catholic Emancipation. The previous year, an Irish Catholic was elected to Parliament but could not take his seat under existing rules. The Tory government now faces pressure to grant Catholics full rights. Bocton explains: "The Tories know they must give in, but they also know that if they do, it will be the ruin of them in Ireland and may finish them in England too. The only hope is that, at the same time as Catholics come in, we also have reform—so that the new members returned will strengthen us." It is pure political calculation: "If we grant reform we may be strong enough to survive."</p>

<p>Bocton stands for the St Pancras seat and wins, gaining Carpenter's support through his carefully calibrated appeal to moderate reform principles.</p>

<h3 id='1831-the-reform-bill-crisis'>1831: The Reform Bill Crisis</h3>

<p>By March 1831, the great Reform Bill is moving through Parliament. Bocton warns Carpenter that the vote will be close. He is right—the historic measure passes the House of Commons by exactly one vote. "Mine," Bocton claims with a wry smile.</p>

<p>When a wrecking amendment destroys the bill, Carpenter is not distressed, correctly predicting the Whigs will call an election and win. During the election campaign, Bocton learns that his father has purchased a rotten borough seat for his grandson George de Quette. When Bocton confronts his father, the old earl casually admits buying the seat but seems vague about which way George will vote, asking instead about betting odds on the election. This conversation reveals the earl's declining mental state, though Bocton focuses only on his political calculations.</p>

<p>In October 1831, the Reform Bill passes easily through the Commons—Lord Bocton and his son George pass through the lobby together, bringing an ironic unity to the family. Carpenter is pleased, expecting smooth passage through the House of Lords.</p>

<h3 id='october-1831-the-betrayal-and-commitment-to-bedlam'>October 1831: The Betrayal and Commitment to Bedlam</h3>

<p>That evening, Carpenter receives a shocking message from Bocton: the House of Lords has thrown out the Reform Bill by a narrow majority, and the Earl of St James was one of the peers who voted against it. When the furious Carpenter confronts the earl at his Regent's Park house, he finds an old man in a gorgeous fifty-pound silk dressing gown, confused and fumbling. The earl can only mumble: "They were going to take away George's seat." He has forgotten that George's rotten borough seat was supposed to be abolished—he has voted against reform to protect his grandson's seat.</p>

<p>Carpenter, blinded by rage, fails to see that the Earl of St James is not in full possession of his faculties. He shouts at the old man: "You old fool! You evil old aristocrat! You're the same as all the rest of them. Ordinary men are just a game to you." He storms out, never seeing the earl staring after him in genuine puzzlement, asking the empty room: "Who am I?"</p>

<p>For Bocton, this is the perfect opportunity. He tells Silversleeves: "I think my father shows promising signs... of madness. Indeed, he could go to prison" for the unpaid rates issue from years before. When Silversleeves asks if prison wouldn't serve Bocton's purpose, he snaps: "Bedlam's better."</p>

<p>On October 6, 1831, the Earl of St James wanders to Seven Dials in the early morning, wearing a greatcoat over his silk dressing gown, speaking in broad cockney and asking for "me dad" Harry Dogget and looking for "Sep." He has regressed to his childhood identity as Sam Dogget. When Bocton and Silversleeves arrive, they witness this complete transference of personality.</p>

<p>Silversleeves declares: "It is a most remarkable case. A complete transference of personality. Notice the change of voice. He even seems to suppose he has another family... Oh, entirely" mad.</p>

<p>When Bocton asks when they can lock him up, Silversleeves says: "Now, if you like."</p>

<p>"That would suit me admirably," Bocton replies. "It will even help the political process." With the public fury over the Lords' rejection of reform threatening riots, Bocton notes drily: "The absence of my father will reduce that necessity by one"—meaning one less Whig peer will need to be created to pass reform.</p>

<p>At eleven-thirty that morning, the Earl of St James is taken to Bedlam in a closed carriage and admitted to the hospital.</p>

<h3 id='october-1831-the-escape'>October 1831: The Escape</h3>

<p>However, Bocton's triumph is short-lived. His son George, discovering what has happened, goes to Meredith the banker for help. Meredith cunningly gains access to Bedlam while Bocton and Silversleeves are away, impersonates the personal physician of King George IV, claims he has orders to escort the earl to another location, and successfully spirits him away to Mrs. Penny's house on Clapham Common.</p>

<p>When Bocton learns his father has escaped, he exclaims in frustration: "Damn! We should have chained him up."</p>

<h3 id='1832-reform-achieved'>1832: Reform Achieved</h3>

<p>The Great Reform Bill finally passes into law in the summer of 1832, abolishing rotten boroughs, giving members of Parliament to new towns, and extending the vote to a fair spread of the middle class. Lord Bocton, having voted for reform throughout the process, has achieved his political objective—though his father, the man whose radical politics first inspired the reform movement, remains hidden away, having been judged insane by his own son.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='earl-of-st-james-father'>Earl of St James (Father)</h3>

<p>Bocton's relationship with his father defines his entire character and drives his actions throughout the chapter. It is a relationship characterized by mutual contempt, fundamentally opposed values, and Bocton's obsessive focus on his inheritance.</p>

<p>The two men could not be more different. The Earl of St James is a sporting, gambling, radical Regency buck who dresses flamboyantly and supports the Rights of Man. Bocton is conservative, penny-pinching, traditional in dress, and fears "the people" as a dangerous mob. The earl mocks his son mercilessly, calling him a bottle because of his dark green coat, suggesting he has no friends, and openly joking that Bocton wishes him dead to get the money.</p>

<p>Bocton's resentment of his father is driven primarily by money and impatience. The earl's extravagant plans—building houses in Regent's Park, supporting radical causes—represent threats to the family fortune. When the earl declares he will live to be a hundred, Bocton can barely conceal his distress at the thought of being over seventy when he finally inherits.</p>

<p>This toxic dynamic leads Bocton to conspire with Cornelius Silversleeves to have his father declared insane and committed to Bedlam. Bocton coldly calculates that his father's radical politics can be characterized as madness: "From enthusiasm to obsession; from obsession to lunacy." He is willing to imprison his own father in an asylum to secure his inheritance and prevent further dissipation of the family fortune.</p>

<p>The ultimate irony is that when the earl's mental faculties do actually decline, Bocton's response is not concern but satisfaction—he finally has the evidence he needs. His commitment of his father to Bedlam represents the culmination of years of resentment, and when his father escapes, Bocton's only regret is: "We should have chained him up."</p>

<h3 id='george-de-quettegeorge-de-quette-1805html-son'><a href="characters/George-de-Quette-1805.html">George de Quette</a> (Son)</h3>

<p>Bocton's relationship with his son <a href="characters/George-de-Quette-1805.html">George</a> is complex and revealing. George takes after his sporting grandfather rather than his conservative father—he is "renowned as the wildest, and jolliest young buck in England," can "ride like a jockey, fight like a turkey-cock," takes no account of social rank, and is legendary with women. This suggests George rejects his father's rigid values in favor of his grandfather's sporting, egalitarian spirit.</p>

<p>The relationship appears distant. When the Earl of St James purchases a rotten borough seat for George during the 1831 election, Bocton is completely unaware of it. He learns about it from Carpenter, and when he confronts his father, the old earl casually dismisses it: "Didn't I? Must have slipped my mind." This suggests a family dynamic where the grandfather and grandson have a closer relationship than father and son.</p>

<p>However, there is a moment of political unity: when the Reform Bill passes through the Commons in October 1831, "Lord Bocton and his son George passed through the lobby together." Carpenter observes: "So the measure has even brought unity to that family." This rare moment of agreement suggests that despite their personal differences, father and son can align on political principles.</p>

<p>George's response to his grandfather's commitment to Bedlam further illuminates the family dynamics. He immediately goes to Meredith for help in rescuing the earl, demonstrating loyalty to his grandfather over his father. This suggests George views his father's actions as unconscionable, despite his own political alignment with reform.</p>

<h3 id='zachary-carpenterzachary-carpenter-1771html'><a href="characters/Zachary-Carpenter-1771.html">Zachary Carpenter</a></h3>

<p>Bocton's relationship with <a href="characters/Zachary-Carpenter-1771.html">Carpenter</a> evolves from mutual hostility to pragmatic political alliance, though it never becomes genuine friendship. They begin as ideological enemies—Bocton the Tory who fears "the people," Carpenter the radical who champions the Rights of Man.</p>

<p>Their first encounter in 1819 establishes their antagonism. Bocton challenges Carpenter's rhetoric, warning that he and the Earl of St James are about to provoke a riot. The philosophical chasm between them is profound: when Carpenter speaks of "the people," he means responsible individuals and property owners; when Bocton uses the same term, he envisions "a terrifying, lawless mob." Bocton calmly declares: "We all should" fear the people, Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<p>By 1829, Bocton has calculated that he needs Carpenter's support to win the St Pancras seat. His approach is shrewd: he carefully identifies the limits of Carpenter's radicalism, establishing that they both believe only taxpaying men should vote (not women, not the poor, not apprentices or beggars). He rejects the secret ballot in terms Carpenter might respect ("cowardly underhand"). Most importantly, he appeals to Carpenter's pragmatism: reform is now necessary for political stability, even if his own motivations are cynical.</p>

<p>Carpenter, though initially suspicious ("What the devil was he up to?"), is ultimately won over. The alliance works because Bocton has correctly judged Carpenter's character—he is a moderate radical, a property owner, a man who wants reform but within limits.</p>

<p>Their collaboration on the Reform Bill demonstrates a functional working relationship. Bocton warns Carpenter that votes will be close; Carpenter trusts Bocton's parliamentary judgment. When the earl betrays reform by voting against it, Bocton sends Carpenter a message—suggesting he maintains some respect for his political ally's right to know.</p>

<p>The relationship represents the pragmatic coalitions necessary for political change: conservative reformers like Bocton and moderate radicals like Carpenter, united not by friendship or shared ideology but by mutual recognition that the old system must evolve to survive.</p>

<h3 id='cornelius-silversleevescornelius-silversleeves-1775html'><a href="characters/Cornelius-Silversleeves-1775.html">Cornelius Silversleeves</a></h3>

<p>Bocton's relationship with <a href="characters/Cornelius-Silversleeves-1775.html">Silversleeves</a> is purely transactional—a conspiracy between a grasping heir and a corrupt asylum superintendent. Silversleeves, deputy superintendent of Bedlam, provides Bocton with the professional cover to declare his father insane.</p>

<p>Their interactions are characterized by cold calculation. Silversleeves offers quasi-medical justifications for declaring the earl mad: "His sense of responsibility: diminishing, without a doubt. Believes he'll live to be a hundred: delusion. Spending all his money: incapacity." Most tellingly, he identifies the earl's radical politics as the "kernel" that will "ripen into madness": "From enthusiasm to obsession; from obsession to lunacy."</p>

<p>Bocton is blunt in his questions: "So you'll be able to lock him up?" and "When?" There is no pretense of concern for his father's welfare—only impatience to complete the scheme. When Silversleeves suggests prison might serve Bocton's purpose, he snaps: "Bedlam's better."</p>

<p>The relationship reveals the corruption possible in England's asylum system, where medical judgments could be purchased to serve family interests. Silversleeves is willing to abuse his professional authority for an aristocratic patron, and Bocton is willing to exploit that corruption for his inheritance.</p>

<p>Their partnership culminates in the commitment scene at Seven Dials, where Silversleeves provides the professional diagnosis ("A complete transference of personality... entirely mad") and Bocton immediately orders the commitment ("Now, if you like"). The efficiency of their collaboration demonstrates how easily the powerless—even an earl—could be institutionalized when family interests and medical authority aligned.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Lord Bocton embodies the anxious conservatism of the English aristocracy and gentry during the post-Napoleonic period. Born around 1770, he came of age during the French Revolution and the Terror, experiences that shaped his fundamental worldview. For Bocton and men like him, "revolution" did not mean the noble independence of American colonists but rather the bloodshed of the guillotine, the Gordon Riots of the 1780s, and historical memories extending back to Wat Tyler's revolt.</p>

<p>The early 19th century was a time of profound social anxiety for the propertied classes. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 brought economic dislocation: returning soldiers unemployed, textile industry contracting, grain prices high. The Peterloo Massacre of 1819—when troops charged a crowd in Manchester, killing over a dozen people—crystallized fears that England stood on the brink of revolution. Every public meeting became tense with the possibility of violence.</p>

<p>Bocton's fear of "the people" was not unusual. Many respectable shopkeepers and craftsmen, though they might want reform, shared his dread of general disorder. The question of who should vote divided even reformers: radicals like Tom Paine advocated "One Man One Vote," but moderates like Carpenter hesitated. Should the apprentice, the journeyman, the beggar in the workhouse have the same electoral power as the property owner? Bocton's position—that only taxpaying men should vote—represented mainstream conservative reform opinion.</p>

<p>His political transformation from Tory to reform supporter in 1829 reflects the pragmatic calculations forced upon conservatives by Catholic Emancipation. When an Irish Catholic was elected to Parliament in 1828 but could not take his seat, it became clear that the old system could not hold. Many Tories, recognizing that Catholic rights were inevitable, sought to couple that change with parliamentary reform that might admit new members who would strengthen conservative interests. Reform became preferable to revolution.</p>

<p>Bocton's treatment of his father reflects the reality of England's asylum system in this period. Bedlam, though recently moved to a vast new building in Southwark, remained a place where the inconvenient could be confined on dubious medical grounds. The practice of selling tickets to view the inmates reveals the dehumanizing attitudes of the era. Families with resources could use medical authority—or purchase it through corrupt practitioners like Silversleeves—to control troublesome relatives, especially when inheritance was at stake.</p>

<p>The Great Reform Bill of 1832, which Bocton ultimately supported, represented England's successful navigation between revolution and reaction. By extending the franchise to the middle class while maintaining property qualifications, by abolishing rotten boroughs while preserving aristocratic influence through the Lords, the bill achieved gradual reform without upheaval. Men like Bocton—conservative reformers motivated more by self-preservation than idealism—were essential to its passage. They represented the English aristocracy's grudging recognition that adaptation was necessary for survival.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Lord Bocton embodies several key themes in Rutherford's exploration of London's history and English political development.</p>

<p>Most fundamentally, he represents <strong>the conflict between old and new, tradition and reform</strong>. His old-fashioned dress, conservative politics, and rigid manner contrast sharply with his father's Regency flamboyance and radical sympathies. Yet Bocton himself undergoes transformation, demonstrating that even the most conservative forces can adapt when necessity demands. His journey from Tory die-hard to reform supporter illustrates the pragmatic flexibility that allowed England to achieve democratic reform without revolution.</p>

<p>Bocton also illuminates <strong>the theme of fear versus progress</strong>. His terror of "the people," rooted in historical memory of the Gordon Riots and Wat Tyler's revolt, represents genuine anxieties of the propertied classes. Yet this fear, while real, could be overcome by rational calculation. Bocton supports reform not because he ceases to fear disorder but because he recognizes that controlled reform prevents violent upheaval. His character suggests that progress often comes not from visionaries but from fearful conservatives who choose evolution over revolution.</p>

<p>The <strong>father-son relationship</strong> between Bocton and the Earl of St James represents generational conflict and the corruption of family bonds by money. Bocton's willingness to commit his father to Bedlam for financial gain illustrates how inheritance could poison familial relationships in aristocratic England. The irony that Bocton inherits his father's Ducket blood—a family historically associated with ruthless ambition—is not lost. Yet the fact that Bocton's own son George sides with his grandfather suggests a rejection of Bocton's values by the next generation, offering hope for moral correction across time.</p>

<p>Bocton's conspiracy with Silversleeves highlights <strong>the abuse of medical and institutional authority</strong>. The ease with which a wealthy heir could purchase a diagnosis of insanity and commit an inconvenient relative reveals the vulnerability of even the powerful when family interests and professional corruption aligned. This subplot critiques Victorian society's treatment of the mentally ill and the elderly, showing how institutions supposedly devoted to care could become instruments of control.</p>

<p>Finally, Bocton represents <strong>the ironic engines of political change</strong>. He votes for reform not from idealism but from calculation; he champions parliamentary representation not from belief in the Rights of Man but from recognition that Catholic Emancipation requires a conservative counterweight. Yet his vote counts equally with that of any idealist. The Reform Bill passes by one vote—a vote Bocton claims as his own. This suggests that historical progress often results not from pure motives but from the convergence of varied interests, some noble and some base. The flawed man and the calculating politician can be agents of positive change, even if for all the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>In the multigenerational tapestry of London's history, Bocton represents a specific type: the anxious conservative who adapts to survive, the son who betrays his father for inheritance, the calculating politician who votes for the right measure for cynical reasons. He reminds us that history is made not only by heroes and visionaries but also by fearful, mercenary men whose self-interest happens to align, briefly, with the march of progress.</p>
