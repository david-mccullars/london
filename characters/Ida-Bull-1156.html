<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Ida is a proud noblewoman, daughter and widow of a knight, who in 1189 is sold by King Richard I to the wealthy London merchant Sampson Bull as part of the king's fundraising for the Third Crusade. At thirty-three years old, she finds herself forced into a marriage she considers a humiliating "disparagement" – a union with a man beneath her social class. Her struggle to accept this new life, her fierce attachment to the values and privileges of the knightly class, and her gradual adaptation to her role as a merchant's wife form the core of her story during this turbulent period of London's history.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Ida is thirty-three at the time of her marriage to Bull. She has a long, handsome face with dark brown hair worn in a bun and covered by a wimple beneath her headdress. She wears the flowing robes and veil appropriate to a lady. Her body is slim and pale with small breasts and long legs. Everything about her appearance and bearing proclaims her status as a member of the knightly class. She has large brown eyes that can express both admiration and scorn with equal intensity.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Ida is defined above all by her pride in her noble birth and her fierce attachment to the values of the knightly class. She is not particularly clever or politically astute, possessing instead "nothing but the prejudices of her class to sustain her." Her worldview is shaped entirely by feudal hierarchy: she believes in absolute obedience to the king, views merchants as inherently inferior to knights regardless of wealth, and considers any questioning of this social order to be impertinence.</p>

<p>Despite these limitations, Ida possesses genuine warmth and capacity for affection. She quickly develops a motherly love for her stepson David, having never been a mother before, and finds she enjoys the role. She is dutiful in learning to manage her husband's household and business affairs, adapting with surprising competence to tasks like inspecting wool and cloth just as she once supervised grain and cattle.</p>

<p>Her pride can make her cruel. When frustrated or reminded of her diminished station, she lashes out with contempt, telling David that his merchant father is "only a merchant" and that "nobles are born, not made." She is capable of making a fool of herself in pursuit of social recognition, such as her transparent attempts to attract the attention of the visiting knight Gilbert de Godefroi.</p>

<p>Yet Ida is also capable of courage in defending principles she believes in. She supports David's desire to go on crusade despite the dangers, declaring "it's the principle that matters" even when it contradicts her husband's wishes. She is devout in her religious observances and genuinely moved by displays of piety.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1189-forced-marriage-and-arrival-in-london'>1189: Forced Marriage and Arrival in London</h3>

<p>In August 1189, Ida is brought to London by Pentecost Silversleeves to be sold in marriage to Sampson Bull. She is thirty-three years old, poor, bringing no estate with her. She has been identified as one of numerous widows whom King Richard I is selling to raise funds for the Third Crusade. The transaction is possible only because Silversleeves knows Bull is seeking a noble wife to advance his family's social standing.</p>

<p>As she crosses London Bridge for the first time, everything seems to her "turned to stone" – the walled city appears as a vast prison, with its Norman fortifications and dark St Paul's cathedral feeling oppressive and forbidding. When she first sees her future husband's "coarse, red face and heavy-set frame" outside St Mary-le-Bow, she faints.</p>

<p>For three desperate days, Ida tries to avoid the marriage. She appeals to the justiciar at the Exchequer but finds no one interested. She attempts to claim kinship with the powerful Lord Fitzwalter at Baynard's Castle, but he deliberately avoids seeing her, having no use for poor relations. Having exhausted all options, the brief ceremony takes place at St Mary-le-Bow with only family attending.</p>

<h3 id='early-months-of-marriage'>Early Months of Marriage</h3>

<p>Ida takes stock of her new situation with discouragement, seeing only satisfaction on Bull's face – which is accurate, as he views marrying her as setting "a crown upon" his achievement of reclaiming the Bocton estate. She is touched by the pious nature of Bull's elderly mother and quickly bonds with young David, who is lonely and grieving his own mother's death. She is surprised and pleased to meet <a href="characters/Brother-Michael-Bull-1143.html">Brother Michael Bull</a>, finding his kindness and intelligence attractive.</p>

<p>Her wedding night proves humiliating in ways she hadn't anticipated. Bull, understanding her repugnance, sees it as a challenge. The first night she submits in silence; the second night she bites her lip; the third night, despite herself, she cries out with pleasure. Bull later reflects with grim amusement that she has now truly been "disparaged."</p>

<p>Ida adapts to her new role with surprising competence. Though used to running an estate, she learns to take part in Bull's business, inspecting wool, cloth, and silk with a sharp eye. The two kitchen servants are delighted to have a mistress again. She develops a genuine affection for David, listening to his confidences and understanding his disappointment at not being allowed to go on crusade.</p>

<h3 id='september-1189-navigating-conflicting-loyalties'>September 1189: Navigating Conflicting Loyalties</h3>

<p>At King Richard's coronation, when David expresses his desire to join the crusade, Ida supports him despite the danger, telling Bull "I think you should let him go." This is the first time she crosses her husband. When Bull questions whether she still supports crusades given she was sold because of one, she proudly replies, "It's the principle that matters."</p>

<p>However, she makes a foolish mistake by adding contemptuously to Bull, "But since it concerns principles, you would not understand," implying merchants are incapable of understanding honor. Bull begins to redden with anger, and the confrontation is only interrupted by news of the anti-Jewish riot breaking out in London.</p>

<h3 id='michaelmas-1189-political-confrontation'>Michaelmas 1189: Political Confrontation</h3>

<p>Returning home on Michaelmas Day, Ida overhears her husband, Brother Michael, and Pentecost Silversleeves discussing the king's oppressive new tax arrangements. To her horror, Bull declares "If this is how King Richard rules, then let him go to hell" and "London will get another king." She gasps at this treason.</p>

<p>Nothing in her life has prepared her for what follows. When she reproves Bull, expecting the king's representative Silversleeves to support her, instead she witnesses a pragmatic discussion of political realities. Bull coolly states "The king's a fool" and speaks of London potentially forming a "commune" – a self-governing entity that would challenge royal authority.</p>

<p>Ida, her mind full of the pain of her own humiliation and a desire to remind them she is still a lady, bursts out with a speech expressing all her class prejudices: "You are speaking of the king! We owe him obedience... You call yourselves barons? You're nothing but merchants... The king will crush you, and quite rightly. You should pay your taxes and do as you're told... You forget your place."</p>

<p>Bull responds coldly: "I see I made a mistake when I married you, my lady. I had not realized you were so stupid. But as my wife I believe your place is to obey me, so get out." She leaves, white and shaking, observed by David at the door.</p>

<h3 id='autumn-winter-1189-1190-cold-peace-and-davids-illness'>Autumn-Winter 1189-1190: Cold Peace and David's Illness</h3>

<p>The relationship between Ida and Bull settles into "armed neutrality." Both are secretly hurt, retreating into coldness. David, confused, asks her privately "Is my father wicked?" She admits Bull shouldn't speak against the king but refuses to discuss it further.</p>

<p>Her one satisfaction is pursuing her connection with Lord Fitzwalter. She traps him after Mass at St Paul's, forcing him to acknowledge her, and constantly refers to him as "her kinsman" to impress her husband's friends, taking pleasure in their social discomfort.</p>

<p>In December, the family visits Bocton for the first time. Ida loves the place at once – the modest stone hall and magnificent views across the Weald of Kent remind her poignantly of the life she has lost. When Bull remarks "We always had this place until King William came," she feels, just for a moment, a sense of kinship with him.</p>

<p>In January, David falls desperately ill. Ida nurses him devotedly, telling Brother Michael, "I love him as my own; but there are only your prayers now between him and death." She tries to encourage David to fight, promising "I'm going to find you a noble wife."</p>

<h3 id='may-1190-the-knight-and-temptation'>May 1190: The Knight and Temptation</h3>

<p>Gilbert de Godefroi, a knight from Sarum on his way to crusade, stays in the Bull house. For Ida, it is as though she has at last encountered someone who speaks her own language. She is transformed, dressing in her finest, serving him first, and behaving as if Bull and even Brother Michael barely exist. She makes a complete fool of herself and her husband.</p>

<p>Ida claims Godefroi's attention immediately, telling him of her ancestry, how she has been disparaged, searching for common connections. Her large brown eyes give him looks that say "Rescue me." She even tries to join him at his prayers. Bull watches all of this in silence.</p>

<p>David, meanwhile, falls in love with the knight as a hero figure, following him everywhere, watching him practice with sword and mace. When Godefroi rides out one morning, David remarks to Ida, "I wish my father was like that." Ida cruelly responds, "Don't be silly. Just look at your father. You can see at once that he's only a merchant... Nobles are born, not made." This teaches David to view his own father as inferior, a wound that will last.</p>

<p>Brother Michael, troubled by Ida's behavior, confronts Godefroi at St Paul's, suggesting he should leave. The pious knight responds coldly, "You accuse me of adultery, monk?... I have no need to leave." When Godefroi finally departs to the Holy Land, he refuses Ida's offer of her glove as a token, reminding her sternly, "I am a pilgrim to the Holy Land."</p>

<h3 id='summer-1190-reading-with-brother-michael'>Summer 1190: Reading with Brother Michael</h3>

<p>After Godefroi's departure, both Ida and David become listless. David's health suffers and Bull asks Brother Michael to help with his studies. Ida often joins these sessions, sitting beside them as Michael instructs David in Latin, history, and the geography of the world. The three form an intimate circle, with Ida looking at Michael with admiration and evident affection. <a href="characters/Sister-Mabel-Barnikel-1148.html">Sister Mabel Barnikel</a>, witnessing this, perceives what she believes is an "unnatural love" growing among them.</p>

<h3 id='late-spring-1191-crisis-at-bocton'>Late Spring 1191: Crisis at Bocton</h3>

<p>When Bull and Ida go to Bocton for the month of May, they leave David in London with Brother Michael. During this time, Michael secretly arranges for David to enter Westminster Abbey as a monk, using a legacy from his mother to fund it. He believes he is saving David's soul and fulfilling God's purpose.</p>

<p>Upon their return in June, Brother Michael announces the wonderful news to Ida. Her reaction shocks him completely. Her face becomes "as hard as a knight's" and her eyes look at him "with scorn, as if he were an impertinent peasant to be cut down." When he speaks of God's work, she retorts: "David a monk? How would he have children?... God has no need of my step-son. He will marry into a noble family."</p>

<p>When Michael questions whether she would put family pride before God and David's happiness, she explodes: "Let others be the judge of that, you meddling old virgin. Get out of this house and go back to your wretched cripples and your cell."</p>

<p>She and Bull find themselves in perfect agreement on this matter. Ida immediately takes David back to Bocton, removing him from his uncle's influence. The crisis draws Ida and Bull together in a new way. At Bocton, they seem for the first time to have truly become man and wife, sitting together in the sun, discussing improvements to the manor, united in their plans for David's future. The subject of Michael's monastery scheme is practically forgotten, though the monk's relationship with the family is likely permanently damaged.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='sampson-bull'>Sampson Bull</h3>

<p>Ida's relationship with her husband is complex and evolves significantly. Initially, she views the marriage with pure horror – not because of Bull's personality (which she scarcely considers) but because marrying a merchant, regardless of his wealth, is a humiliating "disparagement" that violates the social order she holds sacred.</p>

<p>Bull understands her revulsion and sees it as a challenge. His sexual conquest of her, making her respond with pleasure despite herself, is a deliberate act of mastery. His comment that she has been truly "disparaged" shows both his shrewd understanding and his capacity for cruelty.</p>

<p>Their relationship hits its lowest point when she lectures him about political disloyalty and calls him stupid for not understanding principles. Bull's response – calling her stupid and ordering her out – cuts deeply, and they enter a long period of cold armed neutrality.</p>

<p>However, shared experiences gradually draw them together: David's near-fatal illness, their mutual love for Bocton, and their united opposition to Brother Michael's attempt to make David a monk. By summer 1191, sitting together at Bocton and planning their stepson's future, they seem for the first time to have truly become man and wife. Bull's amusement at her continued insistence on finding David a noble wife, rather than irritation, suggests he has accepted her foibles while she has adapted to his world.</p>

<h3 id='david-bull'>David Bull</h3>

<p>Ida's relationship with her stepson is perhaps the most successful and genuine connection in her new life. Having never been a mother before, she discovers she enjoys the role. David is lonely after his mother's death, and Ida provides the motherly attention he needs.</p>

<p>She understands his disappointment about not going on crusade and supports his desire to do so, showing she respects the values of honor and duty that matter to a young man of knight's blood (even if he is only a merchant's son). She promises him, "I'm going to find you a noble wife," seeing in him the potential to restore something of what she has lost.</p>

<p>During his illness, she nurses him devotedly, telling Brother Michael "I love him as my own." Her threat to David during his sickness – "Fight, David. Remember, I'm going to find you a noble wife" – shows how she uses her ambitious plans for his future as encouragement.</p>

<p>However, her class prejudices lead her to damage David's relationship with his own father. By telling him his father is "only a merchant" and that "nobles are born, not made," she teaches him to view Bull with the contempt of the knightly class, creating a wound that will shape his future attitudes.</p>

<p>Her furious rejection of Brother Michael's monastery plan – "God has no need of my step-son. He will marry into a noble family" – reveals that her love for David is inseparable from her dynastic ambitions. She wants him to succeed not on his own terms or even God's, but according to the values of the class she was born into.</p>

<h3 id='brother-michael'>Brother Michael</h3>

<p>Ida's initial attraction to Brother Michael is immediate and genuine. She looks into his "kindly, intelligent eyes" and likes him at once, discerning his purity and finding time has wrought "a fineness in his face." Having always admired and been attracted to religious men, she begs him to visit her very soon, causing him to blush.</p>

<p>As their acquaintance develops, she admires his nobility of character, particularly when he saves the Jewish merchant Abraham from the mob. When Michael, Bull, and David all gaze at her admiringly after she speaks of principles, she finds it tempting and makes her foolish speech insulting Bull – suggesting she values their admiration more than domestic peace.</p>

<p>The weekly meals with Michael become important to her, and she wishes they could be more frequent. Later, when David is ill and Michael's prayers seem to be the only thing keeping him alive, she kisses Michael out of gratitude when he predicts David will survive.</p>

<p>The tutoring sessions create an intimate atmosphere, with Ida sitting opposite Michael and David, looking at the monk with obvious adoration. This does not escape Sister Mabel's notice.</p>

<p>However, when Michael arranges for David to become a monk, Ida's fury is absolute and unforgiving. She calls him a "meddling old virgin" and orders him to "get out of this house and go back to your wretched cripples and your cell." This explosion reveals that her admiration for his piety was always conditional on it not conflicting with her dynastic ambitions. She valued him as long as he confirmed her worldview; when he challenged her plans for David's noble future, he became an enemy to be expelled.</p>

<h3 id='gilbert-de-godefroi'>Gilbert de Godefroi</h3>

<p>Ida's behavior toward the visiting knight is transparently desperate and inappropriate. She transforms herself in his presence, dressing as a fine lady, serving him first, speaking as if the others "would not understand." She tells him her ancestry, her grievances about disparagement, searches for connections, and gives him looks that beg "Rescue me."</p>

<p>That Godefroi is a perfect, pious knight about to depart on crusade makes him an impossible fantasy object – he represents everything about the world she has lost. Her attempt to give him her glove as a token and his stern refusal – "I am a pilgrim to the Holy Land" – is a final rejection of her desperate attempt to reclaim connection with her former world.</p>

<p>The episode shows Ida at her most foolish and pitiable, making a spectacle of herself while her husband watches in silence. Yet it also reveals the depth of her loss and longing for the life and status she once had.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Ida's story unfolds during the momentous events of 1189-1191, at the beginning of King Richard I's reign and the Third Crusade. Her personal experience of being sold in marriage is part of the massive fundraising effort for Richard's crusade – the king famously declared he would "sell London itself" if he could find a buyer.</p>

<p>Her forced marriage illustrates the practice of "disparagement" – the controversial royal prerogative of marrying noble widows and heiresses to men of lower social status. This was particularly resented by the knightly class, who viewed such marriages as violations of the natural social order. Ida's horror at being forced to marry Bull reflects widespread aristocratic attitudes of the time.</p>

<p>Her arrival in London coincides with a period of dramatic tension between the city and the Crown. King Richard's aggressive taxation and his appointment of royal stewards rather than allowing the city to elect its own sheriffs created the conditions for civic resistance. Ida's inability to understand the political sophistication of London's merchant class – her assumption that loyalty to the king is simple and absolute – reflects the gap between feudal and urban political cultures.</p>

<p>The anti-Jewish riot that erupts on coronation day, September 3, 1189, is historically significant as the first major anti-Jewish violence in England. That Ida witnesses Brother Michael's courageous rescue of Abraham shows her exposure to the religious and ethnic tensions of the period.</p>

<p>The visiting knight Godefroi embodies the ideals of chivalry that were reaching their height in this period – warrior, pilgrim, and courtly figure combined. The Third Crusade was inspiring in young men like David exactly the kind of religious and martial fervor that Ida, as a member of the knightly class, instinctively understands and supports.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Ida represents the collision between the old feudal world and the rising power of urban merchant wealth. Her insistence that "nobles are born, not made" and her contemptuous view that merchants should "pay their taxes and do as they're told" embody an aristocratic worldview that is being challenged by the economic and political realities of the age. The fact that Bull can purchase both the Bocton estate and a noble wife illustrates that wealth, not birth, is increasingly determining social position.</p>

<p>Her character explores the theme of social class and identity. Unlike Bull, who pragmatically seeks to buy his way into the nobility over generations, Ida clings desperately to her identity as a lady despite her poverty and lack of power. Her pride is all she has left, which makes it both admirable in its refusal to surrender and tragic in its ultimate futility. Her attempt to attract Godefroi and her pursuit of Lord Fitzwalter's acknowledgment show how desperately she seeks validation of her noble status.</p>

<p>The theme of adaptation versus resistance runs through Ida's story. She successfully adapts to practical aspects of merchant life – learning Bull's business, managing his household, even finding pleasure in her husband's bed. But she refuses to adapt her fundamental beliefs about social hierarchy, and this rigidity causes her to poison David's relationship with his father and to permanently rupture her connection with Brother Michael.</p>

<p>Ida's fierce opposition to David becoming a monk – "God has no need of my step-son. He will marry into a noble family" – reveals the limits of her religious devotion. Though genuinely pious, she will not allow piety to interfere with dynastic ambition. This makes her representative of the often-conflicted relationship between religion and worldly concerns in medieval society, where faith was sincere but rarely permitted to challenge family interests.</p>
