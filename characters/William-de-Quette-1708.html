<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>William de Quette, third Earl of St James, is a cautious, prudent aristocrat of the Georgian era whose marriage to the fashionable Miss Barham proves disastrous. His story culminates in 1751 when he is killed in a duel with Captain <a href="characters/Jack-Meredith-1722.html">Jack Meredith</a>, manipulated into the confrontation by his own wife. Though not a central figure, William represents the tensions between old merchant wealth and new aristocratic pretensions in eighteenth-century London society.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>William de Quette is neither good-looking nor bad-looking, his looks described as "bland." He takes after his fair, conventionally pretty mother. In his early forties by 1750, he wears a powdered wig and favours richly embroidered coats - wearing a blue one when confronting his wife about bills. He has "the first beginnings of a respectable paunch" and hands that are "universally agreed to be fine" and "always beautifully manicured." The narrative suggests that in another decade he would probably look rather impressive.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>William is fundamentally a prudent, cautious man - traits that define both his strengths and his ultimate failure. His investments, though cautious, are shrewd; the Bocton estate is well-run; and he is an active member of the House of Lords in the Whig interest. He lives within his income and carefully manages his finances, unlike his extravagant wife.</p>

<p>Yet this very prudence renders him unexciting to his fashionable spouse. His wife wishes he would "take some wild risk" - though not one that could jeopardize their comfort. He is capable of small gestures of accommodation, as when he changed the family name from Ducket to de Quette to please her during their courtship when he was "quite dazzled by her." But after this initial infatuation, he becomes steadfast in refusing her more extravagant demands, such as her desire to rebuild Bocton house in the latest fashion or redecorate their London house entirely in the French rococo style.</p>

<p>William demonstrates some awareness of his wife's feelings and attempts, in his limited way, to address them. He confronts her about the substantial bills she has run up, but does so without cruelty. When he raises the painful subject of providing an heir - reminding her that they once had a son before - he speaks "gently" and apologizes when he realizes he has broached the forbidden topic of their dead child.</p>

<p>His manner with his wife is generally courteous but increasingly distant. He understands that she finds him "insupportable" but seems unable or unwilling to change his nature to please her. There is a sadness in his situation - a fundamentally decent man trapped in a loveless marriage with a woman who despises him for his very virtues.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-marriage-c-1708-1742'>Early Life and Marriage (c. 1708-1742)</h3>

<p>Born around 1708, William inherited the earldom as the third Earl of St James, carrying the responsibility of a title recently elevated from merchant stock. His grandfather had been <a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Julius Ducket</a>, and the family name still proclaimed their origins in trade - something that would prove a source of humiliation for his future wife.</p>

<p>Around 1734, William married Miss Barham, who was "the belle of every ball." During their courtship he was "quite dazzled by her" and made his most significant concession to please her: changing the family name from Ducket to the French-seeming "de Quette." Miss Barham found the tradesman's name Ducket unbearable - "half the memorial tablets in London proclaimed some Ducket or other to have been an alderman, guild member or merchant." She told her friends the new spelling was "the older form of the name which only time had corrupted" and that the earl's family must have come over with the Norman Conquest. Though it is pronounced, as she insisted with "a show of English firmness," as "Ducket."</p>

<p>This act of renaming represented the high point of William's efforts to please his wife. She later reflected sadly that "that was the last time he had really tried to please her."</p>

<h3 id='the-tragedy-of-the-heir-c-1742'>The Tragedy of the Heir (c. 1742)</h3>

<p>Around 1742, Lady St James gave birth to a son named George, who carried the courtesy title Lord Bocton from birth. The child was born with dark hair featuring a curious white streak and webbed fingers - physical characteristics that horrified the countess. She "let out a little scream" and shrieked "It's not mine. You've brought me another child."</p>

<p>This birth precipitated a period of anguish for the marriage. Lady St James felt "horror at herself" and "horror at her husband therefore, who had caused her to have such a thing." Shortly after, when Lord St James was obliged to make a journey to northern England, the countess executed a secret plan to exchange the child for a dead infant. She drove in a mad rush to Bocton with the baby, and a doctor from Rochester announced the next day that the child "has been been dead a whole day at least."</p>

<p>When Lord St James returned from the north, he found his heir "safely buried in the little churchyard by the deer park at Bocton" and his wife "practically out of her mind with grief - so much so that for a time he had feared she might go mad." The loss of this heir remained "an area of darkness, the thing they did not mention" in their marriage for the next eight years.</p>

<h3 id='final-year-1750-1751'>Final Year (1750-1751)</h3>

<p>By 1750, William resided primarily at number seventeen, Hanover Square - a handsome four-storey house with big sash windows, five across, in the fashionable Whig neighborhood. Despite his wife's expensive tastes, most of the meat and produce consumed there came by cart once a week from the Bocton estate in Kent, helping to manage costs.</p>

<p>In April 1750, William confronted his wife about bills from tradesmen totaling three hundred pounds - including charges from a hatmaker, milliner, Twining the tea-seller, her shoemaker, dressmaker, perfume-sellers, <a href="characters/Isaac-Fleming-1710.html">Isaac Fleming</a> the baker, and even a bookseller. While she had been receiving plans for a new mansion at Bocton (which he had "no intention of telling her"), he insisted: "If we are not ruined, it is because I live within my income."</p>

<p>During this confrontation, he also raised the painful necessity of producing an heir: "The family of de Quette, madam. I am the third earl. I still have no heir. Something must be done." When she suggested waiting until summer at Bocton, he replied briefly: "Summer is a long way off" - unaware that his wife was already conducting an affair with <a href="characters/Jack-Meredith-1722.html">Jack Meredith</a> and planning his death.</p>

<p>Lady St James soon after orchestrated a scheme with Meredith: he would provoke a duel with Lord St James and kill him, then marry her and gain access to her fortune to clear his debts. She sent Meredith a note in the middle of the night before the duel warning him: "For God's sake take care, Jack. He means to kill you" - ensuring that Meredith would not show mercy.</p>

<h3 id='the-duel-1751'>The Duel (1751)</h3>

<p>At dawn in Hyde Park, in a dell screened by spreading oaks, William de Quette faced Captain Jack Meredith in a formal duel with swords. Seven men were present: the two duelists, four seconds (two for each man), and a doctor.</p>

<p>The duel was brief. Meredith was "a far swordsman" compared to William, who was only "fair." Meredith noted with surprise that his opponent "did not seem to be pressing him very hard" and concluded this was "probably a ruse." He waited cautiously for nearly a minute before seeing his chance. "With a single swift and deadly lunge, he shot his rapier straight into Lord St James's heart."</p>

<p>The doctor exclaimed: "My God, sir, was that necessary?" But Meredith only shrugged, honoring the bargain he had made with Lady St James - and motivated by her false warning that the earl meant to kill him.</p>

<p>"Within seconds, the earl was dead."</p>

<h3 id='aftermath'>Aftermath</h3>

<p>Lady St James's plan to secure Meredith proved more complicated than expected. On the day after their Fleet Marriage, when she and Meredith returned to Hanover Square, they discovered that the little chimney-sweep boy caught stealing in their house was in fact the abandoned heir - recognized by his webbed hands and white-streaked hair. Meredith insisted: "I've killed the father. But I'm damned if I'll disinherit the child. If you don't take the child back, I will leave you."</p>

<p>Thus George, "the former Lord Bocton and now the new Earl of St James, was restored to his home" - William de Quette's true heir reclaimed after eight years living as a street urchin in Seven Dials. Though William never learned the truth about his son's survival, the title and estate he preserved through his careful management ultimately passed to his legitimate heir, as he would have wished.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='lady-st-james-miss-barham'>Lady St James (Miss Barham)</h3>

<p>William's marriage to the fashionable Miss Barham began with genuine attraction - he was "quite dazzled by her" when she was "the belle of every ball." His decision to change the family name to please her demonstrates how much he initially wished to accommodate her desires. But after this early period, the relationship deteriorated into mutual estrangement.</p>

<p>Lady St James found her husband "insupportable," wishing he were less cautious and more willing to take risks. In his presence, "it was difficult for Lady St James to convey even the modicum of encouragement necessary for her own self-preservation." She avoided his bed, allowing him into her chamber only by her "express permission," telling him dramatically it was "the only courtesy I ask."</p>

<p>William seems aware of her unhappiness but unable to change his fundamental nature. He is not cruel - he speaks to her with courtesy and even gentleness - but neither is he the exciting, dashing figure she craves. The death of their infant son created an unbridgeable chasm between them, "the subject that must never be discussed."</p>

<p>By 1750, when she had fallen in love with Captain Meredith, William became "insupportable to her" as long as Meredith remained in London. She orchestrated William's death without apparent remorse, using her husband's own challenge (likely provoked by her hints about Meredith) to engineer his murder in a duel she knew he could not win.</p>

<h3 id='captain-jack-meredith'>Captain Jack Meredith</h3>

<p>William's relationship with Meredith was apparently cordial but distant - the relationship of social equals who occasionally encountered each other at clubs. Meredith remarked casually that Lord St James "plays for damnably low stakes" and had "never got more than five pounds off him at the club" - suggesting they played cards together occasionally.</p>

<p>William seems unaware of Meredith's affair with his wife until some event prompted him to issue a challenge. The circumstances that led William to call Meredith out are not detailed in the narrative, but given Lady St James's manipulation of events, she likely arranged for William to discover some evidence of the affair that would compel him to defend his honor.</p>

<p>In the duel itself, William proved to be a "fair swordsman" facing a far superior opponent. He did not press Meredith hard - whether from genuine lack of aggressive intent or from inferior skill is unclear. Meredith, believing (falsely) that William meant to kill him, showed no mercy and killed William with a single deadly lunge through the heart.</p>

<h3 id='george-de-quette-his-son'>George de Quette (his son)</h3>

<p>William knew his son only as an infant who died - or so he believed - shortly after birth. When he returned from his northern journey to find the heir buried at Bocton and his wife "practically out of her mind with grief," he remained "mystified by the business." The loss of this heir haunted the marriage, becoming "the thing they did not mention."</p>

<p>Eight years later, when confronting his wife about the need for an heir, he broke their unspoken rule by mentioning the dead child: "You gave me an heir once before... I'm sorry. Poor little George." His reference was gentle and apologetic, showing genuine sorrow at the loss.</p>

<p>William never learned that George had survived, exchanged for a dead child, and raised as a street urchin in Seven Dials. After William's death, George was restored to his rightful position as Earl of St James, inheriting the title and estates his father had carefully managed. Those who remembered the old earl "would remark that the son was a much more amusing fellow than his father" - though George's personality owed more to his upbringing among the cockneys than to either of his parents.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>William de Quette lived during the prosperous Hanoverian period when Georgian England was secure, wealthy, and expanding. The German Hanoverian dynasty, though "stupid" and speaking "English poorly," had brought "peace and prosperity." The Jacobite threat had been crushed at Culloden in 1745, and British colonial trade from America, the Caribbean, and India brought "an ever-increasing flow of wealth."</p>

<p>As a Whig member of the House of Lords, William was part of the political establishment that supported the Hanoverian settlement and dominated Parliament. Hanover Square, where he lived, was "much favoured by Whig politicians." His class was benefiting enormously from "improved agricultural methods" and "the burgeoning colonial trade" that were "yearly increasing his already substantial income."</p>

<p>William's situation illustrates the complex attitudes toward wealth and status in Georgian England. His family represented the new nobility - merchant wealth recently elevated to the peerage. His grandfather had been a Ducket, a name proclaiming merchant origins that appeared on "half the memorial tablets in London" as aldermen, guild members, and merchants. This was the reality of English aristocracy: trade and nobility mixed freely, at least on the female side.</p>

<p>The name change from Ducket to de Quette reflects a broader cultural shift. Whereas "to the end of the Stuart age, the younger sons of the gentry were still becoming mercers and drapers," by the mid-eighteenth century the upper classes had genuinely come to believe that "Gentlemen do not engage in trade." This was "a piece of historical nonsense" that would govern English lives "for more than two centuries to come." Yet the system was "redeemed by only one concession to common sense": gentlemen and noblemen, "including even the ducal families, cheerfully and publicly married the daughters of merchants."</p>

<p>The duel that killed William was part of the aristocratic culture of the period. In "the elegant eighteenth century" arranging private duels had become fashionable, providing "an incentive to be polite." The law was mild - if you killed your opponent, "you risked a fine, or perhaps a nominal three months in jail. That was all." Hyde Park, with its "ancient oaks and quiet glades," was a convenient location for such encounters at dawn.</p>

<p>William's household at Hanover Square represented the pinnacle of Georgian elegance: footmen in crimson livery with white silk stockings, a butler and housekeeper managing the staff, a cook and pastry chef, coachman and grooms. Lady St James even owned Pedro, a black slave boy in a little crimson coat - one of the nearly fifty thousand slaves a year being "shipped from Africa to work the sugar plantations of the West Indies and the tobacco plantations of Virginia," with many passing through London where "Negro boys were often bought as toys and domestic servants."</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>William de Quette embodies several important themes in the novel's exploration of London's history and society.</p>

<p><strong>The Merchant-Aristocrat Transition</strong>: William represents the transformation of merchant wealth into aristocratic status - and the anxieties that accompanied this transformation. His very name tells the story: originally Ducket, a solidly mercantile name, it was fancified to "de Quette" to create the illusion of Norman ancestry. This cosmetic change could not erase the family's origins, but it satisfied the new social pretensions of the Georgian era when "gentlemen do not engage in trade" became the governing fiction, even though the reality was that most aristocratic fortunes had fairly recent commercial roots.</p>

<p><strong>Prudence versus Passion</strong>: William's cautious, prudent character contrasts sharply with his wife's desire for excitement and emotional fulfillment. He lives within his income, manages his estates shrewdly, and acts responsibly - all admirable qualities that nevertheless make him "insupportable" to a woman seeking passion and dash. His tragedy is that his very virtues doom his marriage. He is neither villain nor hero, but simply an adequate man married to a woman who demands more.</p>

<p><strong>The Duel as Class Performance</strong>: William's death in the duel represents the elaborate performance of honor required of Georgian aristocrats. Though manipulated into the confrontation, he felt compelled by social codes to fight. The duel itself, with its formal procedures, designated seconds, and doctor in attendance, was a ritualized piece of theater that could nevertheless end in real death. William's participation in this ritual, even though he was only a "fair swordsman" facing a superior opponent, demonstrates the power of class expectations to override individual judgment or survival instinct.</p>

<p><strong>The Innocent Victim</strong>: Unlike many characters in the novel who suffer as a consequence of their own moral failings, William is largely an innocent victim. His wife orchestrates his murder not because he has wronged her - indeed, he is courteous, provides her with wealth and status, and attempts in his limited way to address her concerns - but because she wants another man. William's death serves the novel's darker theme: that innocence provides no protection in a world where passion, ambition, and moral callousness can ally to destroy the merely decent.</p>

<p><strong>Ironic Justice</strong>: There is a certain irony in William's legacy. He died believing his line had ended with the infant George's death, and he died specifically so his wife could marry her lover and control the St James fortune. Yet George survived, was restored, and inherited everything William had preserved. His careful management of the estate ensured there was something substantial for his true heir to inherit. Meredith, though he briefly gained access to the fortune, acted as "guardian to the young Earl of St James" and "carried out fully and faithfully" his obligations, "taking only a perfectly proper fee" - suggesting that even the man who killed William ultimately served William's interests by protecting his son.</p>

<p>William de Quette's story is ultimately one of quiet tragedy: a decent, if unexciting man, destroyed by forces he never fully understood, leaving behind a son he never knew survived to inherit the position he had tried to preserve.</p>
