<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>John Dogget is a cheerful and good-natured boat-builder who runs a thriving boat repair business in Southwark at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century. Inheriting the boatyard established by his grandfather <a href="characters/Dan-Dogget-1510.html">Dan Dogget</a>, John becomes known for his merry disposition, his flash of white hair, and his webbed hands – both distinctive Dogget family traits. His life encompasses romantic disappointment with <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a>, the building and care of a royal barge, two marriages, and a near journey to the New World aboard the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>John Dogget has a "flash of white hair" and a "merry face." His hands are slightly webbed between the fingers, a hereditary trait shared with other members of the Dogget family. He works alongside his "rubicund father" in the boatyard, and his general bearing suggests a man comfortable with physical labor, covered in woodshavings and riverweed from his daily work.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>John is fundamentally cheerful and contented with his lot in life. His father taught him that "if you can make a woman laugh, you'll be all right," and he takes this advice to heart – he is popular with both men and women in Southwark, known for making people laugh. He is not easily discouraged; when <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a> seems interested only in <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a>, he remains optimistic, noting "there were plenty of other girls."</p>

<p>He is generous with his time and help, demonstrated when he stays for five hours to help Jane sort and clean costumes in the tiring house without being asked, "as if it were the most natural thing in the world." He is also trusting and open, willing to share his greatest treasure – King Harry's barge – with his new friend Edmund.</p>

<p>As a boat-builder, John has inherited not just his family's business but their practical skills and eye for craftsmanship. He can instantly assess a vessel's seaworthiness, as shown when he immediately recognizes that the <i>Speedwell</i> is "overmasted" and "not seaworthy."</p>

<p>After his second marriage to the Puritan Martha Carpenter, John finds himself caught between his own easygoing nature and his wife's more rigid religious community. The Doggets are "a merry family by nature: hardly a day went by without them finding something funny," but Martha never quite joins in their laughter. Despite his love for her and gratitude for her transformation of his household, he feels that "something died in him" when his daughter declares she wants to marry "a respectable man" rather than a waterman, marking the change in his family's status and character.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1597-1599-the-globe-years'>1597-1599: The Globe Years</h3>

<p>In 1597, John Dogget encounters <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a> at a cock-fighting establishment. He becomes intrigued by <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a>, the red-haired girl working at the playhouse, noting "she's got a bit of money coming to her too." Though Jane seems to have eyes only for Meredith, John remains undeterred and strikes up a friendship with Edmund to learn more about him.</p>

<p>John takes Edmund to his boathouse in Southwark and shows him the treasure hidden there: King Harry's barge. This magnificent vessel, about thirty feet long with benches for four pairs of oars and a gilded cabin, had been purchased by John's grandfather <a href="characters/Dan-Dogget-1510.html">Dan Dogget</a> shortly before the end of his life. For years, father and son had "lovingly tended it, restoring a plank here, a piece of gilding there," until it was restored to its former glory. The barge sits unused, "like an unclaimed bride – mature, beautiful, a Cleopatra waiting for her Mark Antony."</p>

<h3 id='early-1598-courtship-of-jane-fleming'>Early 1598: Courtship of Jane Fleming</h3>

<p>By January 1598, John begins to enter Jane's life more prominently. He often appears at the playhouse and makes her laugh. In February, a crucial moment occurs when a group from the theatre is going to a tavern. Jane must stay behind to work in the tiring house, and without a word, John remains with her and helps sort and clean costumes for five hours. This act of kindness impresses Jane deeply.</p>

<p>A friendship develops. Late in February he kisses her "chastely, as though he expected nothing more." Two weeks later, she allows him to kiss her properly. When her mother observes that "Young Dogget's courting," Jane answers hesitantly: "I think so. Perhaps."</p>

<p>In midsummer, they go out on the river together in the evening. John rows with his webbed hands, wearing a "happy grin." However, Jane feels "an unaccountable sadness and even irritation" during the outing. When they reach Shoreditch and he pulls her into the shadows near the playhouse, "she could only go through the motions of returning his kiss."</p>

<h3 id='summer-1599-rejection-and-the-globe'>Summer 1599: Rejection and the Globe</h3>

<p>By summer 1599, after <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a> becomes more involved with the theatre company and the dramatic project to move the Theatre building to Bankside, Jane's feelings shift. The book notes: "She had almost forgotten about Dogget recently, so close had she and Meredith grown."</p>

<p>When the Globe Theatre opens and Fleming brings the contents of his store to Southwark in carts, Jane appears radiant. "She was bored with Meredith. She had chosen Dogget instead." The boat-builder and Jane "had come to an understanding," and she feels "an extraordinary sense of peace and happiness." She looks forward to telling Meredith of her decision.</p>

<p>However, Jane subsequently disappears from the Globe and from John's life entirely.</p>

<h3 id='c-1600-1611-first-marriage'>c. 1600-1611: First Marriage</h3>

<p>John marries a "lively girl, a waterman's daughter" around 1600 and knows "great happiness" with her. They have five children together. His wife dies suddenly around 1611, leaving him deeply upset and overwhelmed. The "months that followed, however, had been so miserable" that when he encounters Martha Carpenter two years later, he "scarcely knew what he was doing."</p>

<h3 id='1613-marriage-to-martha-carpenter'>1613: Marriage to Martha Carpenter</h3>

<p>In June 1613, the Globe Theatre burns to the ground during a performance of <i>Henry VIII</i>. Shortly thereafter, <a href="characters/Cuthbert-Carpenter-1577.html">Cuthbert Carpenter</a> approaches his sister <a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha</a> about marrying his friend John Dogget. "He needs a wife," Cuthbert tells her; "a Christian woman to look after those children." The five children are "living in disorder" and John is "distracted" with care.</p>

<p>When Martha agrees to consider the marriage, John tells her: "You must teach me how to be a wife." When she suggests there will have to be changes, the harassed father replies: "Of course. Anything you want."</p>

<p>On their wedding day, John has tried to prepare the house by the boatyard, but "the family had always lived in cheerful chaos." Their wedding night sees the essentials "duly accomplished" but brings her, he suspects, little joy. When he returns from work the next evening, however, he finds the house transformed: clean, the children's clothes washed, a large pie and stewed apples on the table, freshly cooked oatcakes from the grate. "That night, overcome with gratitude, he made love to her with tenderness and passion."</p>

<p>Martha quietly wins over the children through her capable household management. The eight-year-old girl wants to cook with her, the oldest boy takes the broom from her to sweep the yard himself. John begins to notice that Martha doesn't quite share the family's sense of humor – she sits "quietly smiling, because she saw they were happy, but not laughing herself." He wonders "whether she had seen the joke." He also senses that while she becomes aroused sexually, "she never took the initiative herself. Perhaps she felt it was ungodly."</p>

<p>When she asks after three months: "Am I a good wife?" – he answers with real feeling: "None better." They have a child together.</p>

<h3 id='1613-1619-life-changes'>1613-1619: Life Changes</h3>

<p>John gradually notices a transformation in his family. The better stallkeepers in Southwark give him and his children "a polite smile – something they had certainly never done before." His oldest girl tells him she wants to marry "a respectable man" rather than a waterman, and John ruefully reflects: "But something died in him that day."</p>

<p>He discovers that Martha comes with "an entire network of similar-minded people stretching across all the city wards and far beyond. It was almost like a huge guild to which she could turn for help." This becomes evident when they quarrel over his eldest boy, who wants to go to sea as a fisherman rather than continue in the boatyard. Martha, after a day of prayer, tells John: "You should let him go. Our work is worship. So if a man hates his work, how can he worship God?"</p>

<p>John is furious and doesn't speak to her for days. But a week later, he finds himself with Martha before the head of the Barnikel family, a prominent Fishmonger, who arranges "a good berth for your boy" and tells John: "Glad to help. Your wife's good name goes before her."</p>

<h3 id='1615-encounter-with-the-ducket-family'>1615: Encounter with the Ducket Family</h3>

<p>In 1615, young <a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Julius Ducket</a> encounters Martha Carpenter and the Dogget family after a sermon. Julius notices that "the boatbuilder and two of his children have a white flash in their hair" and "a sort of webbing, between their fingers." When Julius reports this to his father <a href="characters/Jacob-Ducket-1570.html">Sir Jacob Ducket</a>, Sir Jacob reacts with horror and loathing, muttering about "the curse" and warning Julius to stay away from the Doggets: "They are all accursed."</p>

<h3 id='1620-the-mayflower-adventure'>1620: The Mayflower Adventure</h3>

<p>On a July night in 1620, John stands with his family by the River Thames, waiting to board the <i>Mayflower</i> bound for the New World. He does not want to go. Martha has been approached by agents of the Virginia Company before, but this venture is different – a Puritan community heading for Massachusetts. When the eldest boy announces that the venture could be profitable because of the cod fishing, and a mysterious benefactor offers to buy the boatyard for far more than it's worth and purchase shares in the company for them, John reluctantly agrees.</p>

<p>The voyage proves troubled from the start. The sister ship <i>Speedwell</i> appears low in the water as she arrives at Southampton. John, staring at her, mutters: "She's overmasted." He and his son go aboard and return "shaking their heads": "They've hardly any supplies."</p>

<p>The ships finally leave Southampton in August but the <i>Speedwell</i> springs a leak off Devon. After repairs, they set sail again, but a hundred leagues out, the <i>Speedwell</i> begins failing again. At Plymouth, Captain Jones announces that the <i>Speedwell</i> cannot continue and only about a hundred passengers can proceed on the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p>"In the silence that followed, having held his peace for over six weeks, John Dogget spoke. 'We'll stay,' he said. His children nodded, even the eldest boy. 'We've had enough of you,' Dogget said." Others also admit they would rather not proceed. "'They're not going to make it,' the eldest boy confided to her."</p>

<p>The Dogget family returns to London in September 1620, just as the <i>Mayflower</i> sets sail without them.</p>

<h3 id='october-1620-and-after'>October 1620 and After</h3>

<p>When the Doggets return to London, they wait anxiously to see whether their unknown benefactor will demand the money back. Sir Jacob Ducket, learning that the Doggets have returned and appear to be staying with Carpenter, suffers a stroke.</p>

<p>The mysterious benefactor, however, "must have been a forgiving Christian indeed," because the offer of money stands. John purchases "a modest thatched timber house and adjoining boatyard, just upstream from London Bridge on the city side" in the parish of St Lawrence Silversleeves. As a property-holder and craftsman, he becomes a vestryman – one who "could vote for the beadle and other parish officials." The family settles into their new, more respectable life in the city.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='jane-fleming'>Jane Fleming</h3>

<p>John is attracted to Jane early on, noting her looks, spirit, and that "she's got a bit of money coming to her too." His interest seems genuine rather than mercenary. He courts her patiently and kindly, most notably when he stays five hours helping her with costume work without being asked. He gives her space when she seems interested in Meredith, and even when she indicates greater interest in him by summer 1599, he is not pushy.</p>

<p>The book states that when Jane disappeared from the Globe around 1599, "Dogget had been deeply upset." This suggests their understanding was serious, and her disappearance was painful to him.</p>

<h3 id='edmund-meredith'>Edmund Meredith</h3>

<p>John strikes up a friendship with <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a> partly to learn more about him as a potential rival for Jane's affection. Despite this strategic element, John is genuinely friendly and trusting, sharing his greatest treasure – King Harry's barge – with Edmund and drinking with him at the George tavern in Southwark. Their friendship appears good-natured rather than competitive.</p>

<h3 id='martha-carpenter'>Martha Carpenter</h3>

<p>John "loved his wife" Martha, though their relationship is complex. He is deeply grateful to her for transforming his chaotic household into a clean, orderly, well-fed home. He makes love to her with "tenderness and passion" and judges her as "none better" when she asks if she is a good wife.</p>

<p>However, he finds her puzzling. She doesn't laugh at his family's jokes, only smiles because she sees they are happy. He notices she never initiates sexual intimacy, though she "gently welcomed his advances." He wryly remarks: "I didn't marry a woman. I married a congregation."</p>

<p>The relationship involves compromise and even suppression of John's nature. Martha's Puritan network brings respectability but changes the family's character. John feels that something fundamental is lost when his family becomes too respectable, yet he cannot deny the practical benefits Martha brings.</p>

<p>On the <i>Mayflower</i> venture, John clearly resents being pressured into going. His wife's "good name" has led them into the trap, and he stands on the ship's deck thinking bitterly about "that accursed good name." Yet "what could he do?" His decision at Plymouth to refuse to continue demonstrates that he does have limits – he can assert himself when the situation becomes intolerable.</p>

<h3 id='his-children'>His Children</h3>

<p>John is clearly a loving father. After his first wife's death, he is "distracted" trying to care for five children on his own. The children respond well to Martha's care, but they also remain connected to their father's personality. When the family debates continuing on the <i>Mayflower</i>, "his children nodded, even the eldest boy" when John announces they will stay behind.</p>

<p>The eldest boy, who wants to be a fisherman, works with his father to assess vessels and shares his professional judgment. The relationship between father and son seems marked by mutual respect and shared expertise.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>John Dogget lives through one of London's most vibrant cultural periods: the flowering of Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre. His boatyard in Southwark places him at the heart of the theatrical district, where the Globe and other playhouses were located. He witnesses the construction of the Globe Theatre in 1599, when the old Theatre was dismantled and moved to Bankside.</p>

<p>The boat repair trade in which John works represents an essential service in Elizabethan and Jacobean London, where the Thames served as the city's main highway. The watermen who ferried passengers and the craftsmen who maintained boats formed a significant part of London's working class.</p>

<p>John also lives through the early Jacobean religious tensions between the established Church of England and various Puritan factions. His marriage to Martha Carpenter connects him to the Puritan community, which would eventually lead to the settlement of New England. The <i>Mayflower</i> voyage of 1620, which he nearly joined, represents one of the most significant events in English colonial history.</p>

<p>His encounter with the Ducket family in 1615 touches on deeper themes of class division and family shame. Sir Jacob Ducket's horror at discovering the Doggets' shared physical traits suggests a dark family secret – likely that the Duckets and Doggets are related through some illegitimate connection that Sir Jacob finds mortifying.</p>

<p>The mysterious benefactor who pays the Doggets to leave on the <i>Mayflower</i> is almost certainly Sir Jacob Ducket himself, trying to remove these embarrassing relatives from London. When the Doggets return, Sir Jacob suffers a stroke, but the benefactor (or his heirs) allows them to keep the money, enabling John to purchase better property and rise in social status.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>John Dogget embodies the theme of contentment versus ambition. Unlike characters such as <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a> who seek to "cut a figure in the world," John is fundamentally satisfied with his lot. He is "contented" working in the boatyard, making people laugh, and living a simple life. This contentment is both his strength and, perhaps, his limitation.</p>

<p>His character explores the tension between different versions of English identity and values. John represents the old, merry England – cheerful, unpretentious, finding joy in simple pleasures and honest work. His marriage to Martha brings him into contact with Puritan values that prioritize respectability, godliness, and seriousness over merriment. The transformation of his family from "merry" to "respectable" represents a broader cultural shift in English society.</p>

<p>The preservation and restoration of King Harry's barge serves as a metaphor for generational continuity and pride in craft. Like the barge, the Dogget family business passes from grandfather to father to son, each generation maintaining and improving what they inherit. The barge sits unused, beautiful but purposeless, much like John's own potential sometimes seems unfulfilled.</p>

<p>John's near-voyage on the <i>Mayflower</i> connects him to one of the defining moments of English and American history. His refusal to complete the voyage represents a choice for England over America, for the known over the unknown. While the Pilgrims became legendary, John returns to London and prospers in his own quieter way.</p>

<p>The Dogget family's physical traits – the white flash of hair and webbed hands – serve as markers of family identity across generations in the novel. These traits connect John to his ancestor Dan Dogget and ultimately to the broader Dogget lineage stretching back centuries. They also become plot points when <a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Julius Ducket</a> notices them, suggesting hidden family connections and shameful secrets among London's upper classes.</p>

<p>John's story also illustrates the role of women in shaping men's lives and choices. His attraction to <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a> draws him into the theatrical world; her disappearance leaves him bereft. His marriage to Martha brings order, respectability, and a powerful network of connections, but also constrains his natural temperament. The women in John's life are not passive but actively shape his trajectory.</p>

<p>Finally, John represents the skilled craftsman class that formed the backbone of London's economy.
