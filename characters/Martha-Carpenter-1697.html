<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Martha Carpenter is the eleven-year-old granddaughter of <a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful Carpenter</a> and one of his two favorite grandchildren. Named after her ancestor <a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha Carpenter</a> who died in the Great Fire of London, she has been strictly raised in the Puritan manner and represents the continuation of the Carpenter family's religious convictions in the early 18th century.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>No physical description provided in the text beyond her age (eleven years old in 1708). She is described as having "quiet but determined character" with a "serious face and rather solemn eyes."</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Martha embodies the strictness and conviction of her Puritan upbringing. She is thoughtful, principled, and possesses a clear moral framework that guides her judgments. When confronted with the ornate Anglican cathedral of St Paul's and her grandfather's work carving a bishop's throne, she struggles to reconcile the worldly beauty with her Puritan beliefs. Her use of the word "ornate" to describe her grandfather's finest work reveals her discomfort with such elaborate decoration, which she has been taught to view as potentially idolatrous.</p>

<p>Despite her youth, Martha demonstrates remarkable spiritual maturity and independence of thought. In the Whispering Gallery scene, when her younger brother <a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1699.html">Gideon</a> asks if their grandfather will go to heaven despite his cowardice in letting old Martha die, she responds with theological precision: "Those who are chosen, go... We don't know who is chosen, Gideon." Her responses show she has internalized the Calvinist doctrine of predestination that undergirds Puritan belief.</p>

<p>Martha's character also reveals compassion beneath her strict principles. When Gideon declares he will rescue their grandfather from hell if necessary, she accepts that "We can still love him," showing that affection and moral judgment can coexist in her worldview.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1708-visit-to-st-pauls-cathedral'>1708: Visit to St Paul's Cathedral</h3>

<p>At age eleven, Martha accompanies her nine-year-old brother <a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1699.html">Gideon</a> and their grandfather <a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful</a> on an October day to see the magnificent new cathedral of St Paul's. This is Martha's first time entering an Anglican church; she has been raised entirely within the Dissenting tradition and hesitates before crossing the threshold of what she views as a "popish-looking cathedral."</p>

<p>Her grandfather, proud of his finest work as an assistant to the renowned woodcarver Grinling Gibbons, shows the children the bishop's throne they have carved together for the choir. Martha attempts to be polite about the craftsmanship, calling it "very fine" and "very ornate," but her grandfather can hear "the doubt and disappointment in her voice." The disillusionment deepens when her brother asks who sits in the throne and learns it is for a bishop – a figure that Puritans reject as having no biblical authority.</p>

<p>The visit takes a dramatic turn when, attempting to restore his fallen dignity, O-Be-Joyful confesses to the children that he did not really try to save their namesake Martha during the Great Fire – the family legend he had maintained for decades was a lie. This revelation shakes Martha's perception of her grandfather, though she maintains her theological composure.</p>

<p>In the Whispering Gallery beneath St Paul's dome, Martha and Gideon discuss their grandfather's confession, unaware that the acoustics carry their voices clearly to O-Be-Joyful sitting below. Martha's words are measured and firm: "He lacked courage. He lacked faith, Gideon... We must not lie." Yet she also shows nuance, agreeing with her brother that they can still love their grandfather despite his failings. Her theological understanding that "we don't know who is chosen" reflects a mature grasp of Calvinist doctrine unusual for an eleven-year-old.</p>

<h3 id='early-religious-education'>Early Religious Education</h3>

<p>Throughout her childhood, Martha received daily Bible readings from her grandfather, who had painfully taught himself to read again in his old age specifically to instruct his grandchildren. The family particularly valued John Bunyan's <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>, and Martha grew up steeped in the Puritan worldview that sees life as a moral journey toward salvation, with constant vigilance against sin and worldly temptation.</p>

<p>Martha has heard family stories about her namesake's voyage on the <i>Mayflower</i> and about her other ancestor Gideon who "fought with Cromwell against the king." These narratives of religious conviction and political resistance form the foundation of her identity and values.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='o-be-joyful-carpenter'>O-Be-Joyful Carpenter</h3>

<p>Martha is one of her grandfather's two favorite grandchildren among his seven. He chose to name her after his own mother <a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha Carpenter</a>, whom he failed to save during the Great Fire – a decision that reveals both his love for this granddaughter and his complicated feelings about that traumatic event. By age five, she was receiving daily Bible readings from him.</p>

<p>The relationship is tested during their visit to St Paul's when Martha must confront the gap between the idealized grandfather of family legend and the flawed human being who confesses his cowardice. Her response shows both disappointment and a capacity for continued love. O-Be-Joyful, hearing her whispered words in the gallery, recognizes that she judges him truly: he did lack courage and faith. Yet her theological sophistication – understanding that human beings cannot know who is among the elect – allows her to maintain affection while acknowledging his faults.</p>

<h3 id='gideon-carpenter'>Gideon Carpenter</h3>

<p>Martha's relationship with her younger brother Gideon appears to be one of mutual respect despite their two-year age difference. She is the more theologically articulate of the pair, providing answers to his questions about salvation and damnation. When Gideon impulsively declares he will rescue their grandfather from hell, Martha gently but firmly corrects him ("You can't"), yet she validates his underlying love. The two children have been raised together in the same strict Puritan household and share the same worldview, making them natural allies in processing difficult revelations.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Martha came of age during a period of relative religious tolerance following the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The Act of Toleration of 1689 allowed Protestant Dissenters – those outside the Church of England – to worship freely in their own meeting houses, though they remained barred from most public offices and universities. By 1708, over two thousand such meeting houses operated in England, with London as the most vital center of Dissenting religious life.</p>

<p>The Carpenter family represents one strand of this Dissenting tradition: the descendants of the Puritans who had fought in the Civil War and supported Cromwell's Commonwealth. Unlike moderate Dissenters who might occasionally take Anglican communion for form's sake to qualify for public office, the Carpenters maintained strict separation. Neither Martha nor her brother had ever entered an Anglican church until this visit to St Paul's.</p>

<p>The London Martha inhabited was a city transformed. The Great Fire of 1666, which had claimed her namesake, had led to the complete rebuilding of the city in brick and stone. Sir Christopher Wren's magnificent St Paul's Cathedral, completed in 1708 after over thirty years of construction, crowned the western hill as the most visible symbol of the new London. Yet this architectural triumph represented, to Puritan eyes, a troubling compromise with "popish" aesthetics – its dome echoing St Peter's in Rome, its baroque ornament suggesting Catholic sensibilities.</p>

<p>The fact that her own grandfather had helped create the bishop's throne in this cathedral reflects the complex position of Dissenting craftsmen in the new London. They could work on Anglican churches for pay, contributing their skills to projects that conflicted with their religious principles, yet they refused to worship in those same buildings. This tension between economic necessity and religious conviction was a defining feature of Dissenting life in early 18th-century England.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Martha represents the transmission of Puritan values across generations and the challenges of maintaining religious conviction in a changing world. Named after her great-great-grandmother who died in the Great Fire, she carries forward both a family legacy and a religious tradition. Her visit to St Paul's dramatizes the conflict between aesthetic beauty and religious principle that troubled many Puritans – the temptation of "ornate" worldly creation versus the austere simplicity they believed God demanded.</p>

<p>Her role in the Whispering Gallery scene is particularly significant. As the acoustics of Wren's magnificent dome carry her words to her grandfather below, the scene embodies multiple ironies: the "popish" cathedral becomes the instrument of moral truth-telling; the architectural achievement O-Be-Joyful helped create becomes the setting for his judgment; and the child named after the woman whose death haunted him becomes his judge.</p>

<p>Martha's theological sophistication – her understanding of predestination, her insistence on truth-telling, her nuanced view that humans cannot know who is elect – shows how thoroughly Puritan doctrine had been internalized by the next generation. Yet her capacity for continued love despite moral failings suggests a humanity that transcends rigid doctrine. In this, she offers a more balanced version of Puritanism than her ancestor Gideon's harsh militancy or even old Martha's uncompromising separatism.</p>

<p>The scene ends with O-Be-Joyful hearing the bells of London ring out and feeling, despite his granddaughter's judgment, a moment of joy. Martha's stern but loving response to his confession paradoxically allows him this redemption – she has freed him from the burden of maintaining a lie, even as she clearly acknowledges his failure. In this, the younger Martha helps heal the wound created by the death of the older one.</p>
