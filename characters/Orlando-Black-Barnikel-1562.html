<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Orlando Barnikel, known as "Black Barnikel" on the high seas, was a dark-skinned pirate and sea captain of mixed race who rose to wealth and fame in the Elizabethan age. Born to a Barnikel seafarer and a woman from southern waters, he became one of the feared buccaneers who harried the Spanish Armada, accumulating a fortune through piracy. Despite his success, wealth, and acceptance by his Billingsgate cousins, Orlando faced constant rejection in London society due to his dark skin, leading to a life of profound loneliness and exile. His story is one of extraordinary accomplishment shadowed by the racism that made him forever an outcast in the only place he could call home.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Orlando was a striking figure, particularly unusual in Elizabethan London. His skin was a rich brown, and his eyes were a perfect blue – inherited from his English father. His hair was long and black, hanging in heavy ringlets. At around thirty-five years old (in 1597), he possessed all his teeth, which were sparkling white. He wore a long, sleeveless leather jerkin reaching to his knees, with leather boots, red breeches, and a white linen shirt. He adorned his wrists with golden bangles and carried no sword, only a long, curved dagger.</p>

<p>He carried himself with an almost indolent manner that belied his true nature – beneath his shirt was a splendid athlete's body, strong and supple as a serpent, with a hand as fast as a panther. He was a dead-eye with a pistol. By the time of his death in 1649, his hair had turned white, though his skin remained black.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Orlando possessed the spirit of a Viking despite his dark coloring. He was cunning and strategic, both in combat and in his personal dealings. He had killed men and survived countless battles, never flinching even when lead and cannonballs flew. He was described as having a hand fast as a panther and a body strong and supple as a serpent.</p>

<p>His personality was marked by contradictions. He could be surprisingly tender with women, knowing how to bring them to physical ecstasy, yet he was also capable of kidnapping and controlling them. He was wealthy, accomplished, and capable, yet deeply aware of his status as an outcast. He possessed a quiet dignity, maintaining a stoic exterior even when publicly humiliated.</p>

<p>Orlando carried a profound sense of honor. When insulted by Edmund Meredith's play, his first instinct was to kill the playwright – for he had killed men for far less. However, his cunning prevailed, and he chose a more subtle form of revenge. His eyes would take on a "smoky" look when angered or threatened, though he maintained perfect control over his expression.</p>

<p>Beneath his confident exterior lay a secret rage born of constant rejection. He longed for what seemed impossible: acceptance, a home, a family in London. The desolation he felt was that of "a man who, though he has accomplished all that is possible, discovers that he will still, always be scorned."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-c-1562-1575'>Early Life (c. 1562-1575)</h3>

<p>Orlando was brought to London as a cabin boy by one of the Barnikels of Billingsgate, a seafarer who had encountered him during a voyage to the south. The seafarer cheerfully announced to his astonished family: "He's mine," never offering further explanation. The boy's blue eyes seemed to confirm that he was indeed the sailor's son. The Barnikels of Billingsgate accepted Orlando as family, and he was raised among them.</p>

<h3 id='rise-as-a-pirate-c-1575-1597'>Rise as a Pirate (c. 1575-1597)</h3>

<p>When his father died after ten years and several profitable voyages, Orlando inherited a tidy fortune – enough to acquire a part-share in a ship which he captained himself. With a crew drawn from every port in Europe, he roamed the seven seas as a pirate. In another age he might have been hanged, but in the era when England battled Spain, privateers like Drake were heroes. Queen Elizabeth herself declared, "You cannot control these salty sea-dogs: they go with the wind."</p>

<p>Orlando participated in harrying the Spanish Armada to destruction. Those who sailed with him and men all over Europe who feared him called him "Black Barnikel." His appearances in London were irregular, but whenever he came to port, he would stride down Billingsgate market to the huge stall where the Barnikels carried on their fishmongering business. His cousins, rather proud that this exotic adventurer belonged to them, always gave him a welcome. The Billingsgate folk called him "the Moor," meaning only that his skin was dark.</p>

<p>During his voyages to the Azores and the Americas, his visits to faraway ports resulted in several children, about whom he knew nothing. On his cousins' recommendation, he deposited his chestful of bullion in the strongroom of Alderman Ducket for safe keeping.</p>

<h3 id='1597-first-encounter-with-edmund-meredith'>1597: First Encounter with Edmund Meredith</h3>

<p>Orlando arrived in London hoping to find a wife. He had grown tired of the women of the ports he encountered and, having money enough to settle down, wished to find a bride in the only place he could call home. However, his Billingsgate cousins and Alderman Ducket made clear that no girl in London, no matter how humble, could be induced to marry a blackamoor. "You're our cousin and always will be," they explained, "but marriage..."</p>

<p>At the Curtain playhouse, he encountered <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a>, who mocked him with clever wordplay, suggesting he should go to a monastery rather than expect to see Meredith's refined play. Behind Meredith's wit, Orlando detected contempt. When Meredith boasted that he could write a play about anyone, making them into "a hero; or just as well, a fool," Orlando's eyes became "somewhat smoky." He quietly promised: "I shall come to your play then, young master."</p>

<h3 id='1599-the-blackamoor-and-janes-abduction'>1599: The Blackamoor and Jane's Abduction</h3>

<p>Two years later, Orlando returned to London. He had been in the Azores and the Americas in the interim. His ship was taking on a cargo of cloth before departing again for Portugal, where merchants in the Low Countries had chartered him. He discovered that Meredith had indeed written a play called "The Blackamoor," using Orlando as the model for a villainous character.</p>

<p>Orlando attended the first performance at the Globe, paying sixpence to enter the Lords' Room. He had hoped the play might cast him in a heroic light – enough to impress some girl and help him find a wife. Instead, he found himself portrayed as a loathsome, hideous villain, "as terrible as Tamburlaine, cunning as Mephistopheles."</p>

<p>As the audience realized the real Black Barnikel was present, they began pointing and whispering. The play became a joke at his expense. Gallants in the audience declared him "the real villain," and the crowd began throwing nuts, cheese rinds, apple cores, and cherries at him. Orlando did not flinch – not a muscle of his face moved. He maintained perfect dignity even as he felt profound contempt for everyone there and understood that he would always be an outcast, even in his home.</p>

<p>Rather than kill Meredith, which would risk hanging, Orlando chose a more cunning revenge. He had observed Meredith with <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a> and seen they were close. He would steal Meredith's woman. The night after the play, Orlando and two seamen struck efficiently. They kidnapped Jane, rolled her body into a small sail, and rowed downstream to Orlando's vessel, which sailed before dawn on the ebb tide.</p>

<h3 id='1599-1615-life-with-jane'>1599-1615: Life with Jane</h3>

<p>Jane became Orlando's woman for approximately fifteen years of wandering seafaring life. While she had no choice initially, Orlando was surprisingly tender with her. He never went near London and was too cunning to give her a chance to escape. Jane bore him five children, though only three survived. She eventually recognized that, in a way, she loved him, particularly when she understood his secret rage at being an outcast.</p>

<p>After their third child, a boy, Jane lost two more babies. When the younger boy was twelve and had made his first voyage with his father, Orlando announced: "I'm sailing to America. Come with me." When they reached Virginia, he escorted her off the ship at Jamestown, put a bag of money in her hand, and announced: "It is time for you to leave me now." Jane was almost thirty – young enough to marry and have a family in the colony. She never saw or heard of Orlando again.</p>

<p>Before parting, Orlando made arrangements for Jane's future. He gave his first mate a will leaving her his treasure chest that remained in Alderman Ducket's strongroom.</p>

<h3 id='1615-1649-final-years'>1615-1649: Final Years</h3>

<p>After releasing Jane in Virginia, Orlando gradually settled into a quieter role as a sea-captain for hire, no longer a buccaneer. Men knew him as a shrewd, skillful old operator whose ships came through all weathers and who had a knack for avoiding trouble. The years did not bring him great satisfaction.</p>

<p>His sons came to nothing. Two died. One became a Barbary Corsair, "a lower kind of fellow than he had ever been." A fourth – who knew where he went? They had gone from him, and it was, he now understood, inevitable for a man who was black in a white man's world.</p>

<p>In 1649, Orlando sailed a slow old ship laden with molasses from the Caribbean to Plymouth. During the brief lay-over in port, he chose to die. He died quietly, the harbor-master noting that although the old mariner's hair was white, his skin was black. He died "because he knew in his heart that he had no true reason to live any longer."</p>

<p>Two days after King Charles I's execution in January 1649, Orlando's first mate finally delivered the will to Jane (now Jane Wheeler), having carried it faithfully for twenty years. The document clearly stated that Orlando Barnikel had left her his treasure chest in Alderman Ducket's keeping.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='the-barnikels-of-billingsgate'>The Barnikels of Billingsgate</h3>

<p>Orlando's only true family, the Barnikel fishmongers accepted him as cousin and kin. They were proud of their exotic adventurer relative and always welcomed him warmly when he came to port. However, they were also honest with him about his prospects: no girl in London would marry a blackamoor, no matter his wealth. Their acceptance had limits.</p>

<h3 id='edmund-meredithedmund-meredith-1575html'><a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Meredith represented everything Orlando could not be in London society – a clever, educated, accepted young man who thought nothing of mocking a strange dark-skinned sailor. Their first encounter at the Curtain playhouse established the dynamic: Meredith's wit and casual contempt versus Orlando's dignity and barely concealed rage.</p>

<p>When Meredith used Orlando as the model for a villainous "Blackamoor" in his play, it was the final proof that even when Orlando hoped for heroic portrayal, London would only see him as a monster. Orlando's revenge – kidnapping Jane – was both punishment for Meredith and a solution to his own loneliness. Even years later, Meredith suspected Orlando was responsible for Jane's disappearance, and the rumor of her kidnap vaguely lingered on.</p>

<h3 id='jane-flemingjane-fleming-1583html'><a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a></h3>

<p>Jane was initially a pawn in Orlando's revenge against Meredith, but she became his partner for fifteen years. Though she was kidnapped and had no choice, their relationship evolved beyond simple captivity. Orlando was surprisingly tender with her, and Jane bore him five children. She came to understand his secret rage at being an outcast and recognized that she loved him in a way.</p>

<p>Orlando proved his respect for Jane by choosing to release her in Virginia with money, giving her a chance at a respectable life. He also ensured she would receive his treasure after his death, arranging for his first mate to deliver his will. Their relationship was complex – born of violence and control, yet marked by genuine connection and, at the end, a form of honor.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Orlando's story takes place during the late Elizabethan era and early Stuart period, a time of maritime expansion, privateering, and England's rise as a naval power. The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 represented England's emergence as a major force, and men like Orlando – whether called pirates or privateers – played crucial roles.</p>

<p>The era saw few people of African or mixed-race descent in England. While the country had some diversity in its port cities, London society was overwhelmingly white and deeply prejudiced. Even a wealthy, accomplished man like Orlando could not overcome the barrier of his skin color. The few dark-skinned people in England faced automatic assumption of lower status, regardless of their actual circumstances.</p>

<p>The theatres of Shakespeare's London were just emerging. The Globe opened in 1599, the very year of Orlando's humiliation. Plays about "Moors" and outsiders were popular, with Shakespeare's "Othello" (c. 1603) and "The Merchant of Venice" (c. 1596-97) exploring themes of the outsider in society. Edmund Meredith's play "The Blackamoor" represents the era's fascination with exotic, threatening "others."</p>

<p>The period also saw the beginning of English colonization of North America. Virginia was established in 1607, and by 1615 when Orlando left Jane there, Jamestown was a struggling but established settlement desperate for settlers and particularly for women. The colony would later become deeply involved in the slave trade, making Orlando's story particularly poignant – a free man of color in an era just before racial slavery became institutionalized in English colonies.</p>

<p>By the time of Orlando's death in 1649, England had undergone civil war and executed its king. The age of the buccaneers was over. The Puritans who dominated under Cromwell had no use for the old sea-dogs who had defended Elizabethan England. Men like Orlando, who had once harried the Spanish Armada, were now seen as criminals deserving to be chained at Wapping and drowned by the tide.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Orlando Barnikel embodies the tragedy of the eternal outsider. Despite extraordinary accomplishments – wealth, fame, military heroism, and success by any objective measure – he remains forever excluded from the society he considers home. His story explores how racism creates insurmountable barriers, denying even the most successful individuals the basic human needs of belonging, family, and acceptance.</p>

<p>His character illustrates the arbitrary cruelty of racial prejudice. He has his father's blue eyes and is accepted as "cousin" by the Barnikels, yet his dark skin makes him unmarriageable, mockable, fit only for villainous roles. The fishmongers' attitude – "you're our cousin and always will be, but marriage..." – perfectly captures how acceptance has limits based on color.</p>

<p>The relationship between Orlando and Edmund Meredith represents a collision between accomplishment and privilege. Orlando is wealthier, more traveled, more accomplished in real deeds. Meredith is educated, witty, and comfortably accepted by society. Meredith's pen proves more powerful than Orlando's sword – the playwright can define Orlando's image and make him a villain in the public imagination, regardless of reality.</p>

<p>Orlando's kidnapping of Jane and their subsequent fifteen years together creates a morally complex relationship that mirrors colonialism itself – begun in violence and control, yet developing into something that includes genuine connection, children, and even love. Orlando's decision to release Jane with money and leave her his treasure shows a capacity for honor and generosity despite the violence of their beginning.</p>

<p>His story also reflects the transition from the age of Elizabeth to the Puritan period. Orlando thrives in Elizabeth's time, when buccaneers are heroes and sea-dogs are celebrated. By 1649, the world has changed. The age of privateering is over, pirates are criminals, and men like Orlando have no place. His death in Plymouth as an old sea captain, quietly and without reason to live, marks the end of an era.</p>

<p>Orlando's ultimate fate – dying alone in Plymouth, his sons scattered or dead, never having found a home – represents the human cost of racial exclusion. He gained the world through his voyages but could never gain what he most wanted: acceptance, family, and home. His treasure went to Jane, the one person who came closest to understanding his secret rage and sharing his exile.</p>
