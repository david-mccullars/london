<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Dorkes is a young serf woman living in the labourers' camp at the Tower of London construction site during the 1080s. The daughter of the camp cook, she finds herself responsible for caring for her ailing mother after her father's death. Despite her timid nature and desperate circumstances, she demonstrates quiet determination and dignity. Her relationship with <a href="characters/Osric-1062.html">Osric</a>, initially rejected for practical reasons, eventually develops into a common-law marriage through the intervention of <a href="characters/Alfred-1052.html">Alfred</a>'s wife.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Dorkes is described as pale and small, with an underdeveloped physique that initially makes her appear younger than her years. She has small, nicely formed breasts and brown eyes. Her profile, which at first seems unremarkable, becomes beautiful to Osric as he studies her. She is notably very clean, regularly going down to the Thames at dawn and dusk to wash herself. Osric initially thinks of her as "a little mouse" due to her diminutive size and quiet demeanor.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Dorkes is characterized by her timidity combined with quiet determination. She is reserved and guarded, particularly with men, having difficulty handling drunken advances. Despite her shyness, she demonstrates remarkable dignity, never begging even in desperate circumstances. She is notably clean and orderly in her habits, maintaining personal hygiene standards unusual for the harsh conditions of the labourers' camp.</p>

<p>Her most defining trait is her fierce protectiveness toward her mother. With "quiet determination," she defends and cares for her mother as arthritis increasingly cripples the older woman's hands. She performs odd jobs for people in exchange for food or clothing, thereby keeping both herself and her mother from destitution while always maintaining her dignity.</p>

<p>Dorkes is also deeply practical, almost to a fault. When <a href="characters/Osric-1062.html">Osric</a> first declares his love, she rejects him not because of his disfigured face—which she had "scarcely thought about"—but because of cold economic calculation. She admires his courage and kindness but sees no future in a union with a man who has nothing but a bed of straw. Her practicality extends to concern about how she could care for her mother if she had a man in her life, and what would happen to any children if Osric died.</p>

<p>Beneath her reserved exterior, however, lies genuine feeling. She secretly loves Osric but conceals this fact even from him, believing their situation hopeless. Only when Alfred's wife offers concrete support—care for her mother and some protection for potential children—does her practical nature allow her emotions to prevail.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='c-1078-1080-life-at-the-tower'>c. 1078-1080: Life at the Tower</h3>

<p>Dorkes lives in the labourers' camp established along the inside of the old Roman wall by the riverbank during the Tower of London's construction. Her father had been the cook, and while he lived, she and her mother ate well. However, her father died approximately two years before the main events of the chapter (around 1078), and since then their lives have been hard. Her mother, used for sundry odd jobs, becomes increasingly sickly as arthritis swells and cripples her hands.</p>

<p>With no one else to help them, Dorkes must protect her mother—a necessity in times when "a sickly serf woman without a family did not live long." She performs various small jobs for people, accepting payment in food or clothing, carefully maintaining both herself and her mother above destitution while preserving their dignity.</p>

<p>She maintains an unusual routine of cleanliness, going down to the Thames at dawn and dusk to wash herself. It is during these trips that <a href="characters/Osric-1062.html">Osric</a> first notices her in December.</p>

<h3 id='june-c-1081-the-assault-and-osrics-protection'>June (c. 1081): The Assault and Osric's Protection</h3>

<p>One warm June evening, after washing at the river, Dorkes passes a group of drinking men. One, somewhat drunk, tries to grab her around the waist, calling out: "I've caught a mouse. Give us a kiss." Unlike another girl who might have laughed it off, Dorkes does not know how to handle the situation. She buries her chin in her chest and tries to break free as the man's hands feel for her small breasts.</p>

<p>Osric witnesses this and throws himself so violently at the man that despite being half his size, he knocks him to the ground. After this incident, Dorkes becomes friendly toward Osric. They often chat together or walk about, though she remains guarded with him. Her gaunt mother watches them with her helpless, gnarled hands, but grants Osric nothing more than sad nods.</p>

<h3 id='july-c-1081-meeting-with-ralph-silversleeves'>July (c. 1081): Meeting with Ralph Silversleeves</h3>

<p>Dorkes and Osric encounter <a href="characters/Ralph-Silversleeves-1045.html">Ralph Silversleeves</a> one morning while walking from the river. Ralph, having heard jokes about Osric and the girl but not believing them, suddenly becomes jealous. He remarks: "Whatever are you doing, walking round with this poor little runt?" He tells Osric, "You'll embarrass her with your face, you're so hideous," and strikes Osric with his whip before moving on.</p>

<p>Dorkes whispers that she always ignores Ralph, but the encounter plants seeds of doubt in Osric's mind about his appearance.</p>

<h3 id='autumn-c-1081-declaration-and-rejection'>Autumn (c. 1081): Declaration and Rejection</h3>

<p>On an overcast Sunday morning at the start of autumn, Osric declares his love while they stand on the battlements of the old Roman wall. When he gently puts his arm around her waist, she freezes and draws away. Looking up at his face, she firmly removes his arm and tells him: "Osric, you've been very kind to me, but.. . I do not love you."</p>

<p>When Osric asks if it's because of his disfigured face, she simply tells him to leave. He goes away believing she rejected him because he is "ill-favoured."</p>

<p>The truth, however, is quite different. Though Dorkes had noticed his disfigured face at first, she had scarcely thought about it afterward. She admired his courage and liked his kindness. But she asks herself: "What was the use of that?" Osric has nothing—not even the hut and plot of land that the meanest village serf possesses, only a bed of straw. She foresees his life: "Hauling stones for Ralph Silversleeves who hated him, until he dropped."</p>

<p>Moreover, she has her crippled mother to care for. With a man in her life, how could she manage? She has witnessed the crude couplings in the camp and knows pregnancy would follow. Standing on the wall, gazing out over the city and the massive rising Tower, she curses "the fate that had locked her in this grim prison."</p>

<p>Above all, Osric must not guess her secret: that she loves him.</p>

<h3 id='autumn-c-1081-the-armourers-wifes-intervention'>Autumn (c. 1081): The Armourer's Wife's Intervention</h3>

<p>A few days later, Alfred's wife accosts Dorkes as she walks toward Billingsgate. At first reserved and noncommittal, Dorkes gradually opens up to the older woman's warmth and understanding, finally breaking down and revealing her situation.</p>

<p>Alfred's wife explains that she and her husband are Osric's friends and have tried to buy him out of serfdom. She makes a practical offer: they will care for Dorkes's mother—even taking her into their house if Ralph allows—and will look after any children "in so far as possible" if Osric dies. She acknowledges: "You may get a better offer, of course. If so, you should take it. But it's something at least." She reminds Dorkes that her husband is a master armourer with some standing in London.</p>

<p>After walking back in silence, hardly knowing what to think, Dorkes at last replies: "Thank you. Yes."</p>

<p>A few nights later, Osric looks up in astonishment to see, by the soft glow of the brazier, a small pale figure approaching him.</p>

<h3 id='c-1082-1083-life-together'>c. 1082-1083: Life Together</h3>

<p>Osric and Dorkes make what private space they can for themselves in the lodgings and live together undisturbed. There is no marriage ceremony or official sanctification—in those conditions, none is expected. The other inhabitants simply refer to Dorkes as "young Osric's woman" and to him as "her man."</p>

<p>After about a year, Dorkes's mother is taken into the armourer's house. Shortly after her mother's departure, Dorkes quietly tells Osric that she is going to have a child.</p>

<h3 id='c-1083-birth-of-first-daughter'>c. 1083: Birth of First Daughter</h3>

<p>Dorkes gives birth to a healthy girl who brings Osric great joy. Thanks to Alfred and his family, the child never wants for food or clothing. Osric tells Dorkes: "One day, perhaps there will be a boy as well."</p>

<h3 id='c-1084-1086-second-pregnancy'>c. 1084-1086: Second Pregnancy</h3>

<p>Dorkes becomes pregnant again, but this time the child—another girl—is stillborn. This loss is mentioned as having occurred between their first daughter and their third pregnancy.</p>

<h3 id='spring-1087-third-pregnancy'>Spring 1087: Third Pregnancy</h3>

<p>In the spring of 1087, Dorkes becomes pregnant for the third time. This pregnancy feels different—the baby kicks vigorously inside her, and Osric notices she is carrying this baby differently than before. Both she and Osric are certain it will be a boy.</p>

<p>When Osric muses about the child's future, saying "Maybe, if he has better luck than me, he'll be a carpenter," Dorkes asks what he will name the boy. Osric decides: "I'll give him the name of our greatest English king. I'll call him Alfred."</p>

<h3 id='september-1087-birth-of-a-son'>September 1087: Birth of a Son</h3>

<p>As political intrigue swirls around them—with <a href="characters/Ralph-Silversleeves-1045.html">Ralph Silversleeves</a> searching for hidden arms and <a href="characters/Barnikel-Fishmonger-1140.html">Barnikel Fishmonger</a> planning secret operations—Dorkes goes into labor. Two days before, Osric had thought she was beginning labor, but the birth comes in earnest in early September.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon, within the lodgings by the Tower, Dorkes gives birth to a son. Standing outside and gazing over the Tower into the sky, Osric is unable to speak for several minutes, so great is his joy. He had been right—he has a son.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='osric-1062'>Osric-1062</h3>

<p>Dorkes's relationship with <a href="characters/Osric-1062.html">Osric</a> forms the core of her story. After Osric defends her from a drunken man's assault, she becomes friendly toward him, chatting and walking together. However, she remains emotionally guarded.</p>

<p>When Osric declares his love in autumn, Dorkes rejects him—not because of his disfigured face, but from practical desperation. She admires his courage and kindness but sees no viable future with a man who has nothing. She worries about caring for her mother and about what would happen to any children she might bear if Osric died young.</p>

<p>Secretly, however, she loves him. This is her carefully hidden truth. Only after Alfred's wife offers concrete support does Dorkes allow herself to act on her feelings. She accepts Osric and they form a common-law marriage, living together in the crude conditions of the Tower laborers' camp.</p>

<p>Their relationship, born of pragmatism but rooted in genuine affection, produces three pregnancies: a healthy daughter, a stillborn daughter, and finally a son. Throughout their time together, Osric's devotion to Dorkes never wavers, and while the text focuses more on his perspective, her quiet acceptance of their difficult life together suggests deep loyalty and affection.</p>

<h3 id='mother'>Mother</h3>

<p>Dorkes's relationship with her unnamed mother is characterized by fierce protective devotion. After her father's death, Dorkes becomes her mother's sole support as arthritis increasingly cripples the older woman's hands, leaving them swollen, gnarled, and useless.</p>

<p>Dorkes performs odd jobs in exchange for food and clothing, keeping both herself and her mother from destitution. She maintains their dignity, never begging despite their circumstances. Her mother watches Dorkes's developing relationship with Osric but offers little beyond sad nods, her thoughts remaining mysterious.</p>

<p>Dorkes's concern for her mother significantly influences her initial rejection of Osric—she cannot see how she could care for her mother with a man and potential children in her life. Only when Alfred's wife promises to care for her mother does Dorkes feel free to accept Osric's love. Eventually, Dorkes's mother is taken into the armourer's house, where she presumably receives better care than the labourers' camp could provide.</p>

<h3 id='alfreds-wife'>Alfred's Wife</h3>

<p>Alfred's wife serves as a crucial catalyst in Dorkes's life. Recognizing the situation between Osric and Dorkes, she deliberately accosts the younger woman and, with warmth and understanding, draws out Dorkes's fears and concerns.</p>

<p>Rather than offering empty sympathy, Alfred's wife provides practical solutions: care for Dorkes's mother and protection for potential children. Her intervention transforms Dorkes's impossible situation into a bearable one, allowing love to flourish where only desperation had existed before.</p>

<p>The relationship reflects the networks of female solidarity and practical support that could exist even in harsh circumstances, with an established craftsman's wife extending protection to a vulnerable serf woman.</p>

<h3 id='ralph-silversleeves'>Ralph Silversleeves</h3>

<p>Dorkes has minimal direct interaction with <a href="characters/Ralph-Silversleeves-1045.html">Ralph Silversleeves</a>, but the encounter she does have is significant. When Ralph encounters her walking with Osric, his jealousy prompts cruel remarks about Osric's appearance, calling him a "poor little runt" and saying he will embarrass Dorkes with his hideous face.</p>

<p>Dorkes's response is to whisper that she always ignores Ralph, demonstrating her strategy of avoidance when dealing with those in power. Ralph's words, however, plant destructive doubts in Osric's mind about his appearance, nearly derailing their relationship before it begins.</p>

<p>Ralph's broader role as overseer of the Tower construction also shapes Dorkes's life circumstances, though she appears to avoid direct interaction with him whenever possible.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Dorkes lives during the early Norman period, specifically during the construction of the Tower of London (1078-1097) under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William I</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William II</a>. This was a time of harsh Norman rule over a conquered English population, with labor for massive royal building projects extracted from the subject population.</p>

<p>As a serf, Dorkes occupies the lowest rung of medieval society. Serfs were unfree peasants bound to the land, owing labor service to their lords. The labourers' camp at the Tower consists of "a motley collection"—serfs sent by landholders who owed service to the king, slaves, and criminals bearing mutilations showing their crimes. Discipline is lax, and conditions are primitive, with people claiming patches of straw for beds and constructing crude privacy screens from wood or straw bales.</p>

<p>For a woman in Dorkes's position, life is precarious. Without male protection or family support, survival is difficult. The text notes that "a sickly serf woman without a family did not live long in these times." Women like Dorkes have little control over their circumstances and must navigate a world where sexual assault is commonplace—as demonstrated by the drunk man who grabs her—and where childbirth frequently results in death for mother or infant.</p>

<p>The lack of marriage ceremony for Osric and Dorkes reflects the reality that formal church marriages were often not required or expected for people of their low status. They are simply recognized as each other's "woman" and "man" by the community, a common-law arrangement typical of the time and class.</p>

<p>The involvement of Alfred the armourer and his wife in supporting Dorkes illustrates the craft guild networks and patron-client relationships that provided some social safety net in medieval society. Master craftsmen like Alfred had "some standing" and could offer protection to those beneath them socially, creating vertical bonds of mutual obligation.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<h3 id='survival-and-pragmatism'>Survival and Pragmatism</h3>

<p>Dorkes embodies the harsh pragmatism required of women at the bottom of medieval society. Her initial rejection of Osric, despite loving him, demonstrates her clear-eyed assessment of their economic reality. She cannot afford to follow her heart when doing so might doom both her mother and potential children to starvation. Only when practical support is offered does she allow emotional considerations to influence her decisions.</p>

<p>This theme illustrates how poverty constrains not just material circumstances but emotional and romantic possibilities. Love becomes a luxury that only those with some measure of security can afford.</p>

<h3 id='female-solidarity-and-support-networks'>Female Solidarity and Support Networks</h3>

<p>The intervention of Alfred's wife represents crucial female solidarity across class lines. While Dorkes is a serf and Alfred's wife is the wife of a master craftsman, the older woman recognizes the younger woman's predicament and actively works to create a solution. This female network operates outside formal institutional structures but proves essential for survival.</p>

<p>The theme shows how women in medieval society created informal support systems to navigate a world where they had little formal power or protection.</p>

<h3 id='dignity-in-adversity'>Dignity in Adversity</h3>

<p>Despite her desperate circumstances, Dorkes maintains her dignity, "never begging" even when caring for a crippled mother while living in a squalid laborers' camp. Her insistence on cleanliness—washing at the Thames twice daily when most around her likely did not—represents her refusal to surrender her sense of self-worth despite her low social status.</p>

<p>This theme resonates throughout the novel, where characters of all classes struggle to maintain their humanity and dignity in the face of conquest, exploitation, and hardship.</p>

<h3 id='motherhood-and-sacrifice'>Motherhood and Sacrifice</h3>

<p>Dorkes's fierce protection of her own mother, and later her acceptance of Osric once her mother's care is secured, demonstrates the central importance of maternal bonds and obligations. Even after forming a family with Osric, her first concern remains her mother's welfare.</p>

<p>Later, as she bears children of her own—including a stillborn daughter and finally a son—she joins the generational cycle of maternal sacrifice that characterized women's lives in this era. Her story emphasizes how women's choices were constrained by responsibilities to both the generation above and the generation below.</p>

<p>The relationship between Dorkes and Osric illustrates the fundamental tension between romantic love and economic necessity in medieval society. Their story asks: What is love worth when survival is at stake? The answer Rutherford provides is nuanced—love matters deeply, but it requires at least minimal material support to flourish.</p>

<p>Dorkes and Osric's eventual union, made possible by Alfred's intervention, shows that love and pragmatism need not be opposites. With even modest external support, people at the bottom of society could create genuine partnerships based on mutual affection and respect.</p>

<p>Dorkes represents the countless unnamed, unmarked women whose lives made possible the great monuments of medieval civilization. While the Tower of London stands as a symbol of Norman power and architectural achievement, its construction depended on the labor—and the suffering—of people like Dorkes and Osric.</p>

<p>Her story, told in detail despite her low status, embodies Rutherford's project of giving voice to the hidden masses whose lives rarely entered the historical record. Through Dorkes, the novel insists that these lives mattered, that they contained love, dignity, courage, and meaning despite poverty and hardship.</p>
