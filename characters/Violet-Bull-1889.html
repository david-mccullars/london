<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Violet Bull was the intelligent, rebellious daughter of brewer <a href="characters/Edward-Bull-1828.html">Edward Bull</a> who defied her family's expectations to pursue education and become a prominent suffragette activist in Edwardian London. Distinguished by her brown hair with a striking white flash and hazel eyes, she shocked her family by marrying the much older Colonel Meredith and later became deeply involved in the militant wing of the women's suffrage movement, enduring imprisonment and force-feeding for her cause. Her activism created painful rifts with her children, particularly her eldest son Henry, yet she lived to see women win the vote and survived into the World War II era.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Violet differed noticeably from her siblings in appearance. While the other Bull children had fair hair and blue eyes, Violet had brown hair with a distinctive white flash in it and wide-spaced hazel eyes. As a young woman in 1889, her mother noted that she was "not plain" and assured her she would find a husband, though Violet herself was more interested in intellectual pursuits than marriage at that time.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Violet possessed a fierce intelligence and independent spirit that set her apart from her family from an early age. Her father complained that she was like him in that "there's never any compromise with you. Everything's always either black or white," while he also claimed she was too much like her mother in being a rebel. Her mother countered that "I was never unreasonable," suggesting Violet's stubbornness exceeded even Mary Anne's legendary determination.</p>

<p>Highly educated for a woman of her time, thanks to a scholarly governess who took her far beyond the standard curriculum, Violet developed a passion for learning that led her to desire university education – an almost unthinkable aspiration for a woman of her class in the 1880s. She read works of philosophy from Plato to modern British thinkers like Ruskin, which her mother would hide among her own books to conceal them from Edward.</p>

<p>Her rebellious nature manifested early. As a child, Mary Anne once found her trying on her mother's clothes and soundly smacked her. As a teenager, Violet became "too close" to her father, fussing over him and bringing him his pipe, until Mary Anne firmly told her to "behave accordingly" as his daughter, not his wife.</p>

<p>Violet's defining characteristic was her moral certainty and willingness to sacrifice personal comfort for principle. When denied university education, she refused to simply accept her fate. When she believed in the suffragette cause, she committed to it fully, even at the cost of her relationships with her children. She was contemptuous of those she saw as timid or conventional, once telling her mother: "I know you wouldn't understand. You're perfectly happy doing whatever papa says."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1889-birth-and-early-childhood'>1889: Birth and Early Childhood</h3>

<p>Born in 1889 to <a href="characters/Edward-Bull-1828.html">Edward Bull</a> and Mary Anne Bull at Blackheath, Violet was the youngest daughter in a family that had risen to considerable wealth through Edward's brewery business, particularly from his lucrative government contract during the Crimean War.</p>

<h3 id='late-1880s-1890-education-and-family-conflict'>Late 1880s-1890: Education and Family Conflict</h3>

<p>As Violet grew, her scholarly governess encouraged her intellectual gifts, teaching her far beyond what was considered necessary for a girl. This led to Violet developing the "foolish idea" (as her parents saw it) that she should go to university. When it became clear she was serious about attending the University of London – one of the few institutions that granted degrees to women – her father dismissed the governess in autumn 1889.</p>

<p>The conflict escalated. Edward would not permit his daughter to become a "bluestocking" or work as a governess or teacher. "She may employ an educated woman as a governess," he declared, "but she certainly can't become one." Mary Anne, herself the daughter of Silas the dredger, discouraged Violet's ambitions because they might make the rising family "look too middle class." The atmosphere in the house became "like a perpetual thunderstorm" for two months, with neither Violet nor Edward willing to compromise.</p>

<h3 id='december-1889-meeting-colonel-meredith'>December 1889: Meeting Colonel Meredith</h3>

<p>The one place where hostilities ceased was on their Wednesday afternoon visits to Hatchards bookshop in Piccadilly. During one visit in December 1889, Mary Anne encountered <a href="characters/Colonel-Meredith-1830.html">Colonel Meredith</a>, a distinguished military officer recently returned from India. He invited them to tea at his remarkable house in Holland Park, filled with treasures from his travels.</p>

<p>Violet, sulky at first, became fascinated by Meredith's extensive library containing books in Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit – seven languages plus dialects he could read. When Mary Anne asked his opinion on Violet's university aspirations, he thoughtfully replied that it depended on what she wanted it for, and that "university as such won't do it for you, though I dare say it can help. I never went myself. It's really a matter of the spirit. Destiny, I expect."</p>

<h3 id='december-1889-march-1890-secret-courtship'>December 1889-March 1890: Secret Courtship</h3>

<p>Violet attended the poetry reading at Hatchards that her mother chose not to attend, where Meredith read from his translations of Persian love poems. She began seeing him at least twice a week, claiming to her mother she was attending lectures. In reality, they did attend lectures, galleries, and concerts together, and a passionate relationship developed.</p>

<h3 id='april-1890-marriage-announcement'>April 1890: Marriage Announcement</h3>

<p>In early April 1890, Violet calmly announced to her mother that she was going to marry Colonel Meredith. When Mary Anne protested that she was not of age and her father would forbid it, Violet replied: "I'm nearly of age. Anyway, I could always elope if you force me to." She revealed she had been seeing Meredith regularly for months.</p>

<p>Mary Anne was horrified by the age difference – Meredith was about sixty years old to Violet's twenty. "Think of his age. It's unnatural," she protested. But Violet was adamant: "I love him! We are passionately in love." When her mother expressed shock at the implications, Violet devastatingly added: "After all, mother, one thing is certain anyway. <i>You</i> can't have him."</p>

<p>The marriage went forward. Edward Bull, despite his misgivings, accepted the match because "Colonel Meredith is rich and a gentleman." Violet coolly predicted: "Papa will be quite glad to have me off his hands." The marriage allowed Violet escape from her father's control while giving her access to the educated, cosmopolitan world she craved.</p>

<h3 id='1890s-1914-marriage-and-motherhood'>1890s-1914: Marriage and Motherhood</h3>

<p>Violet's marriage to Colonel Meredith proved fulfilling intellectually and passionately. Despite his advanced age, Meredith "remained so strong and slim" that Violet "supposed he would live to a great age." They had three children: Henry (born c. 1894), Frederick (born 1900), and Helen (born c. 1909, when Meredith was just over seventy).</p>

<p>The marriage situated Violet in a comfortable position in London society, eventually living in Eaton Terrace in fashionable Belgravia. Mary Anne died in 1907, leaving only Esther Silversleeves of the four Dogget sisters.</p>

<h3 id='c-1914-widowhood'>c. 1914: Widowhood</h3>

<p>Colonel Meredith died suddenly of a massive heart attack around 1914, leaving Violet "taken by surprise." He left less money than she had expected, and she found her income "a little stretched" to maintain an appropriate household and educate the three children. Her father Edward stepped in to pay for the children's schools.</p>

<h3 id='1908-suffragette-activism-begins'>1908: Suffragette Activism Begins</h3>

<p>By 1908, Violet had become deeply involved in the women's suffrage movement. The Suffragettes, led by Mrs. Pankhurst, had adopted the motto "Deeds Not Words" and were staging increasingly bold demonstrations. Their colors – purple, white, and green – became symbols of the movement.</p>

<p>In a highly publicized incident that appeared in <i>The Times</i>, Violet and another woman waited outside 10 Downing Street and walked alongside Prime Minister Asquith all the way down Whitehall, politely but persistently enquiring what he was doing about votes for women. This brought her notoriety and caused difficulties for her son Henry at Charterhouse school.</p>

<h3 id='1908-1910-family-conflicts'>1908-1910: Family Conflicts</h3>

<p>Violet's activism created a severe rift with her children, particularly Henry. At Charterhouse, he endured constant teasing: "How's the Prime Minister, Meredith?" and "Have they arrested your mother yet?" Someone even placed a huge placard reading "Votes for Women" over his bed. The harassment became so severe that Henry had to fight other boys.</p>

<p>Edward Bull intervened, taking Henry and some classmates to tea and impressing them with stories of Colonel Meredith's tiger hunting, which restored Henry's standing at school. But Henry told his grandfather he respected his mother's conviction even though he hated the Suffragettes' methods and wished she would support them quietly.</p>

<p>At the British Museum with her children, Violet encountered the consequences of militant suffragette actions. When they were initially refused entry (museums feared suffragettes would smash cases or set fires), Henry had offered: "By the way, mother, which glass case do you want to smash first?" – showing his conflicted feelings of affection and exasperation.</p>

<p>Her father warned her repeatedly about setting a bad example that encouraged other classes to agitate, and about the effect on her children. "Do you think this is very kind to them?" he asked. Violet stormed back: "The children are proud of me! They know what I'm doing is for a good and moral cause." But Edward ominously replied: "Are you sure?"</p>

<h3 id='june-1911-the-coronation-procession'>June 1911: The Coronation Procession</h3>

<p>For the coronation of King George V, the Suffragette movement organized a massive Women's Coronation Procession on Saturday, June 17, 1911. Violet dressed her eight-year-old daughter Helen in the suffragette colors and took her to march in the procession of tens of thousands of women, four miles long, winding from the City past Parliament to Hyde Park.</p>

<p>Violet told Helen: "Our cause is just. You must be prepared to fight for a noble cause, Helen, my child. We are marching for our country, and for a better future." Helen, wearing her long white dress with purple, white and green sash, never forgot the experience of marching in unison with her mother.</p>

<p>That evening, Edward Bull appeared unexpectedly with Henry and Frederick at Violet's house. He was furious that she had "dressed up Helen, an innocent child, as a Suffragette" and taken her to "a demonstration that could have turned into a riot." The confrontation was severe:</p>

<p>"Children should be protected from ideas," Bull declared. Violet retorted: "It would be wrong to take her to church then. She might hear ideas."</p>

<p>Bull threatened: "If you ever use this child in this disgraceful way again, I shall remove her from you. She can live with me at Bocton." When Violet said she would take him to court, he replied that a judge might well agree she was "an unfit guardian for a child."</p>

<p>Most devastatingly, Henry said: "Mother, if such a thing ever happened I should testify against you. I'm sorry. You're unfit." Then he burst into tears.</p>

<p>Little Helen, hiding and watching, "shook with terror" at the scene.</p>

<h3 id='spring-1912-imprisonment'>Spring 1912: Imprisonment</h3>

<p>After the Liberal government ignored all suffragette reform suggestions in November 1911 and gave more votes to working men but none to women, the movement turned to window-smashing, attacks on golf greens, and carefully targeted arson. Violet initially was not involved in these tactics.</p>

<p>In spring 1912, walking back from a meeting, Violet saw women who had broken a window being roughly handled by a policeman. In a fit of rage, she took her umbrella and banged it against the broken window herself. This was enough to secure her arrest.</p>

<p>When Edward Bull found her in a cell, she begged him to bail her out so she could get home to Helen. But he refused: "I'm afraid, Violet, that I am not going to. I shall go to pick up Helen now. She shall come with me to Bocton." He predicted correctly: "I think it is far more likely, Violet, that you are going to prison."</p>

<p>Violet received three months in prison. During this time, Helen lived with Edward at Bocton.</p>

<h3 id='1912-1914-multiple-imprisonments'>1912-1914: Multiple Imprisonments</h3>

<p>Over the next two years, Violet was imprisoned three times. "A sort of fever gripped many in the movement at that time," she later reflected. Enraged by "the cynical contempt shown by even the Liberals," and with her father implacable at Bocton and her sons against her, she told a colleague: "I may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb."</p>

<p>The imprisonments were brutal. During one eighteen-month period, she was in and out of prison repeatedly. At one demonstration she was arrested again and received another six months, but shared it with a dozen other women she knew. "What a camaraderie they had felt!"</p>

<p>The worst came when she and five other women went on hunger strike. Violet "had never known what real hunger could feel like." Then came the horrific force-feeding: "powerful hands dragging open her clenched jaw; the threats to break her teeth. That cruel tube rammed down her throat, the awful searing agony, her throttled screams, the raw, burning pain that remained in her throat, hour after hour, until they came to do it again. The third time she fainted."</p>

<p>When she finally emerged, she was "physically broken."</p>

<p>Only Henry came to visit her in prison. No one else from the family did.</p>

<h3 id='july-1914-reconciliation-and-war'>July 1914: Reconciliation and War</h3>

<p>By late July 1914, with war looming, there was a truce within the family. Edward, "really very old now, shocked by her treatment in prison and desiring only to see his family living in peace," arranged for them all to be reunited at Bocton. Violet had made only a few trips to London in recent months.</p>

<p>A week before war was declared, Henry volunteered for military service and was soon in uniform. The coming war would transform everything.</p>

<h3 id='1914-1918-the-great-war'>1914-1918: The Great War</h3>

<p>The war brought tragedy and triumph for Violet's causes. Henry was gassed at Ypres in 1915 and invalided home, "a shadow, grey and almost lifeless," though the doctor said his young heart saved his life. He remained this way throughout the war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the severe shortage of men at home caused women to step into their jobs – working in munitions factories, on railways, behind counters, operating telephones, doing heavy labor. The Suffragettes gave up their campaign for the duration of the war, but their service made their case. Even Edward Bull, after being hospitalized and seeing that "the whole place was run by women," told Violet: "Very well run too."</p>

<p>In 1917, Prime Minister Asquith gave women the vote, declaring: "They have earned it." Violet's cause had finally triumphed.</p>

<p>But in 1918, as the Great War ended, the Spanish flu pandemic swept the world. Among the more than 200,000 who died in England was Henry. After surviving the war's mustard gas, he died of disease. For Violet, "the memory of that winter had dissolved into a grey blur out of which his poor, pale, ravaged face arose to haunt her. And again and again over the years she had asked herself: should she have let the others do the marching? Why had she given such pain to the child who was gone?"</p>

<h3 id='1920s-1930s-post-war-years'>1920s-1930s: Post-War Years</h3>

<p>After the war, Violet remained in Belgravia at Eaton Terrace. She saw her daughter Helen through the débutante season of the 1920s. Helen reminded her: "You chose an interesting man," when discussing potential husbands.</p>

<p>During the General Strike of 1926, Violet saw it as threatened revolution: "This is the revolution that those Bolsheviks have been waiting for. We've got to beat them." She and Helen worked to break the strike, with Helen acting as a conductor on a bus.</p>

<p>As Europe moved toward another war in the 1930s, Helen began gathering intelligence about German rearmament that Westminster was ignoring. Helen and Violet "built up a detailed dossier" together. Some friends thought them "a little mad"; others, "remembering Violet's militant past, smiled and shrugged."</p>

<h3 id='september-1940-the-blitz'>September 1940: The Blitz</h3>

<p>At seventy years old, Violet lived with Helen in Eaton Terrace during the German Blitz on London. Helen was driving an ambulance, dangerous work that gave her premonitions of death. Violet shared these premonitions but did not confess this to her daughter.</p>

<p>One evening in September 1940, after Helen left for her ambulance duties at 6:15 PM, Violet remained in the house. But she experienced "an extraordinary feeling I was in danger," so went to the shelter in Sloane Square Underground. While she was there, a high-explosive bomb completely destroyed the house in Eaton Terrace. "One glance at it told her that no one could possibly have survived in there."</p>

<p>When Helen returned and found the ruins, devastated at the thought her mother was dead, Violet walked around the corner very much alive. "I must say," she told Helen cheerfully about the shelter, "it's what you might call rather <i>close</i> down there. But wasn't I lucky?"</p>

<p>Violet Bull survived the Blitz.</p>

<h3 id='edward-bull-father'>Edward Bull (Father)</h3>

<p>Violet's relationship with her father was characterized by mutual stubbornness and eventual reconciliation. Edward was a powerful, self-made brewer who had risen to wealth and established the family at the grand Bocton estate. He and Violet clashed bitterly over her desire for university education, with neither willing to compromise. Their confrontations made the house atmosphere "like a perpetual thunderstorm."</p>

<p>Despite their conflicts, Edward showed moments of care. He paid for his grandchildren's education when Violet was widowed. When she was imprisoned and force-fed, he was "shocked by her treatment in prison." In his final years, he mellowed and sought family peace, bringing them all together at Bocton. After witnessing women's wartime service in hospital, he even came around to supporting women's suffrage. His evolution from implacable opponent to grudging supporter represented the broader societal shift Violet had fought for.</p>

<h3 id='mary-anne-bull-mother'>Mary Anne Bull (Mother)</h3>

<p>Violet had a contemptuous relationship with her mother, viewing her as too conventional and subservient. She would tell Mary Anne with "a note of contempt in her voice": "I know you wouldn't understand. You're perfectly happy doing whatever papa says. You've never wanted anything else in your life."</p>

<p>This was deeply unfair to Mary Anne, who had her own history of rebellion and adventure, including a balloon flight and her own attraction to Colonel Meredith. Mary Anne tried to guide Violet pragmatically, warning her that "men don't like women to be too intelligent" and advising her to "learn to conceal it." But Violet rejected this compromise with contempt.</p>

<p>The one peaceful territory was their Wednesday visits to Hatchards bookshop, where they both found escape in literature. Mary Anne would hide Violet's philosophical books among her own to keep them from Edward. Despite her criticism of her mother's conventionality, Violet's own passionate marriage to Meredith may have been partly inspired by witnessing her mother's suppressed attraction to the same man.</p>

<p>Mary Anne died in 1907, before seeing whether Violet's sacrifices would prove worthwhile.</p>

<h3 id='colonel-meredith-husband'>Colonel Meredith (Husband)</h3>

<p>Violet's marriage to Colonel Meredith was passionate, intellectual, and scandalous. The age gap of approximately forty years shocked polite society, but Violet declared: "I love him! We are passionately in love." The marriage gave her everything her father's house denied: intellectual stimulation, worldly sophistication, and a partner who took her mind seriously.</p>

<p>Meredith was "the most educated and the most interesting man I shall ever meet in my life," Violet told her mother. He could read seven languages, had traveled throughout India, China and Arabia, and treated her as an intellectual equal. Despite his age, he fathered three children with her over twenty-four years of marriage.</p>

<p>His sudden death around 1914 left Violet without the partner who had validated her unconventional choices and supported her development. She would spend the rest of her long life without remarrying.</p>

<h3 id='henry-meredith-son'>Henry Meredith (Son)</h3>

<p>Violet's relationship with her eldest son was the most painful of her life. Henry suffered terribly at school because of her suffragette activities, enduring constant mockery and having to fight other boys. He told his grandfather he respected his mother's conviction but hated her methods.</p>

<p>The breaking point came at the 1911 Women's Coronation Procession, when Edward Bull confronted Violet about involving eight-year-old Helen. Henry, weeping, declared: "Mother, if such a thing ever happened I should testify against you. I'm sorry. You're unfit."</p>

<p>Yet Henry remained the only family member who visited Violet in prison. During her imprisonments between 1912-1914, "Henry had come to visit her in prison. No one else from the family had." This suggests a deep love beneath the conflict.</p>

<p>Henry served in World War I and was gassed at Ypres in 1915, returning home "a shadow, grey and almost lifeless." He survived the war only to die in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. For the rest of her life, Violet was haunted by the question: "should she have let the others do the marching? Why had she given such pain to the child who was gone?"</p>

<h3 id='helen-meredith-daughter'>Helen Meredith (Daughter)</h3>

<p>Helen became Violet's most devoted supporter and, in many ways, her successor. Even as a child of eight, Helen felt proud marching with her mother in the 1911 Women's Coronation Procession, though the subsequent confrontation with her grandfather terrified her.</p>

<p>When Edward took Helen to live at Bocton during Violet's imprisonments, the little girl "knew perfectly well from her brothers that she was in gaol" even though Edward tried to pretend otherwise. Despite this disruption, Helen "had always known that her mother was right to serve a cause, despite what the others had said."</p>

<p>As an adult, Helen followed her mother's example of fighting for causes despite opposition. She campaigned against German rearmament in the 1930s when it was unpopular, lost her job for it, and served as an ambulance driver during the Blitz. When she told Violet "You had a cause to serve, I haven't got one," it showed both her admiration for her mother and her desire to emulate her.</p>

<p>During the Blitz in 1940, the two women shared premonitions of danger. When Violet's intuition saved her life by leading her to the shelter before the bomb destroyed their house, it demonstrated the deep connection between mother and daughter.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Violet Bull's life spanned one of the most transformative periods in British history, particularly for women. Born in the Victorian era when women had virtually no political rights and limited educational opportunities, she lived to see women win the vote, serve in both world wars, and achieve unprecedented social freedoms.</p>

<p>The women's suffrage movement that Violet joined had been working quietly for forty years before the Suffragettes adopted militant tactics in the early 1900s. The movement faced opposition not only from men but from many women who believed politics would "pollute" women and that female brains were literally smaller. Even the most radical political parties had little interest in female suffrage, being far more concerned with enfranchising working-class men.</p>

<p>The Suffragettes' militant tactics – window-smashing, arson, accosting politicians, chaining themselves to railings – scandalized Edwardian society. The brutal treatment of imprisoned suffragettes, including force-feeding, shocked public opinion and gradually turned the tide. But it was ultimately World War I that proved decisive: women's essential wartime service made the case for suffrage undeniable.</p>

<p>Violet's family background exemplifies the Victorian nouveau riche. Her father Edward Bull made his fortune supplying drink to the Crimean War army and used that wealth to establish the family as country gentry at Bocton. This created tensions between maintaining respectability and adapting to changing social conditions. Edward's objection to Violet's university education was partly about class: having a daughter work as a governess or teacher would make the family "look too middle class."</p>

<p>The class tensions Violet witnessed – from her father's fear that suffragette agitation would encourage working-class unrest, to the General Strike of 1926 that she helped break, to her daughter's warnings about Hitler in the 1930s – shaped her long life. She saw Britain transform from a confident imperial power to a nation twice nearly destroyed by world wars.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Violet Bull embodies the painful cost of social progress and the tension between personal relationships and moral conviction. Her story asks: what price is acceptable to fight for justice? Should reformers sacrifice their children's happiness for the greater good?</p>

<p>Throughout her life, Violet faced this dilemma. Her militant suffragette activism caused her son Henry years of suffering at school. Her imprisonments meant being separated from her young daughter Helen. Even Henry's devotion – visiting her in prison when no one else would – couldn't erase the damage. His death from Spanish flu in 1918 left her forever questioning her choices: "should she have let the others do the marching?"</p>

<p>Yet Violet's sacrifices were not in vain. Women did win the vote. Helen, far from being traumatized by her mother's activism, became a crusader herself, fighting against Nazi Germany when it was unpopular. Violet's example taught her daughter that fighting for truth matters more than social approval or personal comfort.</p>

<p>Violet represents the generational conflict between Victorian and modern values. Her father Edward epitomized Victorian certainties: women belong in the home, education makes women unmarriageable, class hierarchy must be maintained. Violet rejected all of this. She married for intellectual companionship rather than social advancement. She defied her father's authority. She insisted on women's right to political participation.</p>

<p>The white flash in Violet's brown hair – the hereditary Bull trait that skips generations – symbolizes how unconventional traits persist in families. While her blonde, blue-eyed siblings conformed to expectations, Violet's distinctive appearance matched her distinctive character.</p>

<p>Her marriage to the much older Colonel Meredith represents an unconventional solution to women's limited options. Unable to attend university or pursue a career, Violet found in marriage to an educated, worldly man the intellectual life she craved. The scandalous age gap mattered less to her than escaping her father's control and accessing a world of languages, cultures, and ideas.</p>

<p>The force-feeding Violet endured in prison – "that cruel tube rammed down her throat, the awful searing agony, her throttled screams" – symbolizes the violence used to silence women's political voices. That she survived this and lived another three decades suggests the resilience required of reform movements.</p>

<p>Violet's survival of the 1940 Blitz bomb that destroyed her house provides a fitting coda to her story. Her intuition that saved her life mirrors the moral intuition that drove her activism. That she could cheerfully describe the crowded shelter as "rather <i>close</i>" while standing in the ruins of her home shows the same defiant spirit that sustained her through imprisonments thirty years earlier.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Violet Bull represents the women who fought for rights now taken for granted, paying personal costs that their beneficiaries may never fully appreciate. Her question – "should she have let the others do the marching?" – echoes through history: must every generation's reformers sacrifice their families for progress, or could more have been achieved with less personal cost? The novel offers no simple answer, but honors her courage while acknowledging the real wounds her choices inflicted.</p>
