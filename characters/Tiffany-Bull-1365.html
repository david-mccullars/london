<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Tiffany Bull was the only surviving child of the wealthy mercer <a href="characters/Gilbert-Bull-1330.html">Gilbert Bull</a>, born in 1365. Baptized as Theophania but always called by the English form of her name, she grew up in her father's grand house on London Bridge during the turbulent final decades of the fourteenth century. Her determination to choose her own husband, and her dramatic rescue from drowning by the foundling <a href="characters/Geoffrey-Ducket-1361.html">Geoffrey Ducket</a>, shaped both their lives. After marriage, she became a formidable manager of the family fortune and ultimately inherited the Bulls' ancestral estate at Bocton in Kent.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>As a child and young woman, Tiffany is described as having a wavy mass of dark hair, a pale complexion, a pointed nose, small red lips, and grey-blue eyes. At eleven, dressed for her father's birthday celebration, her mother plaited her hair tightly and wound it into circles over her ears. Though small and with "no breasts to speak of yet" at that age, she was considered "a pretty little thing" who "almost compensated" for her father's lack of a son. By her mid-teens, she had developed a charming figure with "breasts just covered" in her fashionable gowns.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Tiffany possessed a complex personality that evolved from obedient daughter to strong-willed woman. As a child she was docile and meek, always treating her father with respect and seemingly content to follow his wishes. However, beneath this compliant exterior lay a sharp intelligence and an independent spirit that would emerge when tested.</p>

<p>She displayed genuine affection and loyalty to those she cared for, particularly her childhood friend Ducket, whom she visited faithfully even when her father disapproved. Unlike many in her social circle, she judged people by their character rather than their station, forming a bond with the foundling boy and refusing to abandon him even when he was accused of theft and rebellion.</p>

<p>Her intelligence showed in her ability to navigate complex social situations and her willingness to seek truth rather than accept easy answers. When presented with accusations against her betrothed <a href="characters/Benedict-Silversleeves-1352.html">Benedict Silversleeves</a>, she investigated independently, seeking out <a href="characters/Amy-Fleming-1365.html">Amy Fleming</a> to learn the truth about Ducket's character.</p>

<p>Most strikingly, Tiffany demonstrated remarkable courage when her convictions were challenged. Her refusal to marry Silversleeves despite enormous family pressure revealed an iron will. "I will not speak the vows. I'll appeal to the priest. You cannot force me, no matter what you do," she told her father when locked in her room.</p>

<p>In later life, she revealed a shrewd business sense and fierce protectiveness of her family's interests. When her father threatened to remarry and disinherit her, she actively sought to find him a mistress to prevent this, showing both pragmatism and determination: "I don't think you quite understand how much money we're talking about."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1365-1376-childhood'>1365-1376: Childhood</h3>

<p>Tiffany was born in 1365 to <a href="characters/Gilbert-Bull-1330.html">Gilbert Bull</a> and his wife. Baptized with the Latin name Theophania by her priest, she was immediately and forever after known simply as Tiffany, the English form of her name. Her father adored her, though she could never fully compensate for his desire for a male heir. Her mother suffered several miscarriages after Tiffany's birth in failed attempts to provide Gilbert with a son.</p>

<p>She grew up in the grand merchant house on London Bridge, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Whittington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Whittington</a> had lodged before her birth. Her childhood companion was <a href="characters/Geoffrey-Ducket-1361.html">Geoffrey Ducket</a>, a foundling boy adopted by her father. From age five onward, Ducket was "often her companion" and "tried to be kind to her." They would play together, and he would carry her on his shoulders across London Bridge, take her fishing for trout and salmon in the Thames, and generally treat her with protective affection.</p>

<p>A memorable moment in her childhood occurred when she was about five years old. She and Ducket watched from the upstairs window as Whittington dared to "shoot the bridge" – riding the dangerous rapids through the arches of London Bridge in a boat. When Tiffany asked Ducket if he would do such a thing, and specifically "would you do it for me," he kissed her and promised he would.</p>

<p>She was educated in the manner appropriate to a wealthy merchant's daughter, learning to read and receiving instruction in English (the language of her father's household) rather than French.</p>

<h3 id='1376-coming-of-age'>1376: Coming of Age</h3>

<p>At age eleven, on her father's birthday in June 1376, Tiffany was dressed as a grown woman for the first time. Her mother put her in a silk undergown with close-fitting sleeves, covered by an embroidered gown of blue and gold. Her dark hair was plaited tightly and wound into circles over her ears. Despite her small size and undeveloped figure, the effect was "simple and charming" and she felt "deliciously feminine."</p>

<p>At this celebration she met <a href="characters/Benedict-Silversleeves-1352.html">Benedict Silversleeves</a> for the first time, a serious young lawyer introduced by his cousin, Sister Olive from St Helen's convent. Silversleeves impressed the company by expertly explaining how to use the astrolabe that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a> had given her father as a birthday gift.</p>

<p>That evening, her father first raised the question of marriage, expansively promising: "I want you to think about it Tiffany, but I shall never force you. The choice will be yours. You may marry whomever you wish." This promise would become crucial years later. Her father suggested she might consider young Silversleeves, though Tiffany was unsure of her feelings.</p>

<h3 id='1376-1379-adolescence-and-suitors'>1376-1379: Adolescence and Suitors</h3>

<p>Over the next few years, a close relationship developed between Tiffany and her father. He became "fascinated by what was passing in her mind" and would proudly discuss with his wife what Tiffany "really thinks of young so-and-so." He brought a succession of suitors to meet her: young mercers, aldermen's sons, an Italian vintner, a German widower, a Hanseatic merchant, and even a young noble with a huge North Country estate (whom they both agreed was too stupid).</p>

<p>Ducket had promised to visit Tiffany weekly after he left to become apprenticed to Fleming the grocer, and he kept his word for a time. On one bright October day in 1376, they visited Chaucer at his lodgings above Aldgate. After leaving Chaucer's chambers, Tiffany turned to Ducket and remarked, "I've never been kissed. I suppose you know how." When he confirmed he did, she simply said: "Do it, then."</p>

<p>This kiss had unexpected consequences. Silversleeves, who happened to be walking out from Aldgate that afternoon, witnessed the kiss and confronted Ducket, politely but firmly rebuking him for taking advantage of "a young girl from a very different station in life." Though Silversleeves acted with apparent propriety, the incident caused Ducket to drastically reduce his visits to Tiffany, something that "secretly hurt her" despite her understanding of the proprieties involved.</p>

<p>Another memorable encounter occurred on a wet November afternoon in 1377 when Tiffany met her distant cousin <a href="characters/James-Bull-1358.html">James Bull</a> for the first time. The honest but awkward young man, hoping to win favor with Gilbert Bull, stopped Tiffany on the street and bluntly announced: "I think the idea was that I should marry you... I told him I'd be interested." Tiffany, though bemused, kindly told him, "You should never give up."</p>

<p>As she matured, Tiffany found herself confused about what she wanted in a husband. She read romances "of knights dying for the love of their ladies" and experienced "a strange sense of excitement," but when she asked her mother if such men really existed, her mother's response was cautious: "Have you ever met such a man?... You mustn't be too disappointed, then, if you never do."</p>

<h3 id='1379-1381-the-silversleeves-courtship'>1379-1381: The Silversleeves Courtship</h3>

<p>Silversleeves pursued Tiffany with calculated propriety over several years. He dressed in the finest cloth, rode a fine horse, and could converse intelligently on any subject. He told Gilbert Bull that while his family was ancient, his fortune was "only modest," and assured him, "Should I ever find favour in her eyes, I should strive night and day to make her happy." He brought thoughtful gifts to Tiffany's mother every few weeks and presented himself as the perfect suitor.</p>

<p>Tiffany found him "an agreeable friend" and "the most intelligent of all the men I've met," but something was missing. "I don't know. I think I'm too young," she told her mother. Despite her reservations, she had no specific objection to Silversleeves, and her father increasingly favored the match.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1379, Tiffany learned about the controversial poll tax being imposed by the young king's council, and Silversleeves explained its workings to her, predicting (correctly) that "there could be" trouble. That year she also heard rumors about Ducket's scandalous liaison with Sister Olive, though the matter was not discussed with her directly. "So, she thought: he knows. The thought was strangely exciting."</p>

<p>The great Peasants' Revolt of 1381 brought dramatic events to London. Tiffany and her family watched anxiously from their house on London Bridge as Gilbert Bull tried and failed to prevent the alderman from lowering the drawbridge to let Wat Tyler's men enter the city. She witnessed the mob surge past their house, which became engulfed in the moving mass of rebels.</p>

<p>During the revolt, Ducket was wrongly accused of looting and locked in the Bulls' kitchen for days. Tiffany was not told the full details at the time, but afterward, the fat serving girl eventually revealed that "Ducket wasn't in the riots... He was saving a man's life."</p>

<p>One month after the revolt ended in July 1381, when Tiffany was sixteen, she and Silversleeves became betrothed. At Tiffany's request, the wedding was postponed until the following summer.</p>

<h3 id='1382-discovering-the-truth'>1382: Discovering the Truth</h3>

<p>In late 1380, Tiffany was seen walking with Silversleeves on a snowy December day, "wearing rich, fur-trimmed cloaks and fur hats; they were walking side by side, and laughing." The couple appeared happy and well-matched to observers, including a heartbroken Ducket who suddenly realized he loved her.</p>

<p>In February 1382, the fat serving girl finally spoke to Tiffany, confirming Ducket's innocence: "Ducket wasn't in the riots. He was saving a man's life." When Tiffany brought this information to her father, he was unconvinced, citing Dame Barnikel's longstanding suspicions about Ducket being a thief. He forbade Tiffany from seeing Ducket: "you're to stay away from him, if you please."</p>

<p>Despite her father's prohibition, Tiffany sent Ducket a message and met him at St Mary-le-Bow church. When she told him what she had learned about his innocence in the revolt, Ducket seemed unsurprised but showed no resentment. Tiffany then revealed something more troubling: she told him about the suspicions regarding the theft from Fleming. This conversation marked the beginning of Tiffany's doubts about Silversleeves.</p>

<p>In late May 1382, Ducket came to Tiffany at the George tavern with terrible news: Fleming had died by suicide after confessing to stealing his own money (having been defrauded by an alchemist), and Ducket could no longer prove his allegations against Silversleeves. The next day, when Tiffany arrived, Ducket told her simply: "I've lost the person who might have convinced you. I've no proof." When she asked if she had to take his word for it, he nodded: "I've nothing else."</p>

<p>Tiffany investigated independently, seeking out <a href="characters/Amy-Fleming-1365.html">Amy Fleming</a> at the George. She asked Amy directly: "You have seen Ducket every day for years. You must know so much more about his life than I do. Have you any idea if all this could be true?" Amy confirmed Ducket's account of saving Carpenter during the revolt and explained the circumstances of her father's death and his message about trusting Ducket.</p>

<p>As the two young women talked, they both realized simultaneously that Silversleeves must have been the alchemist who defrauded Fleming. "That's it then," Tiffany said, "I'm not marrying him." When Amy pointed out they had no proof, Tiffany simply replied, "Too bad. Never mind. I never really liked him."</p>

<h3 id='1382-the-confrontation-and-fall'>1382: The Confrontation and Fall</h3>

<p>With the wedding only two weeks away, Tiffany stood before her father and announced she could not marry Silversleeves. At first Bull did not believe her: "But the marriage is all arranged. You can't back out now." When he asked why and suspected Ducket's influence, Tiffany replied: "I do not love him, Father."</p>

<p>Bull's response was firm: "I'm afraid you must marry him, and that's the end of it." When Tiffany protested that he had broken his word about letting her choose, Bull roared that she <em>had</em> chosen Silversleeves and now wanted to break <em>her</em> word. The confrontation escalated dramatically, with Tiffany crying "I hate him. He's a villain" and refusing to back down even when Bull threatened to thrash her. When she vowed she would not speak the wedding vows and would appeal to the priest, Bull declared: "Then I'll send you to a nunnery."</p>

<p>Bull locked Tiffany in her room for three days while wedding preparations continued. She was allowed only water and gruel brought by the fat serving girl. Her mother tried to reason with her but failed. Finally, Bull, uncertain what to do, offered a bargain: he would invite various eligible young men to the house, and if Tiffany preferred any of them to Silversleeves, she could marry that man instead. Otherwise, it would be "Silversleeves, or a convent."</p>

<p>Tiffany accepted this compromise but secretly planned to name Ducket, gambling everything on the hope that he loved her and was not already promised to Amy Fleming. She sent the fat girl with a message summoning Ducket to the house that evening.</p>

<p>On the evening of the gathering, about twenty guests assembled in the Bulls' upstairs room, including Silversleeves (who appeared comfortable and at ease), several merchants' sons, and <a href="characters/James-Bull-1358.html">James Bull</a>. Tiffany, wearing a pale violet gown, greeted everyone pleasantly, including Silversleeves, while anxiously watching for Ducket.</p>

<p>When Ducket finally arrived (disguised as a serving girl), Tiffany slipped away to speak with him privately. She asked desperately: "Tell me Geoffrey Ducket – I have to ask, you see – do you love me? I mean, could you?" He answered immediately: "Enough to die for you." (Unknown to Tiffany, Ducket had come armed with a knife, prepared to kill Silversleeves rather than let the marriage proceed.)</p>

<p>Tiffany then approached her father and pointed to Ducket as her choice. Bull's bellow of rage "shook the room." In his fury, Bull "swinging his large arm, struck her face with the open flat of his hand so hard that she seemed to fly from him like a wounded bird."</p>

<p>Tiffany crashed against the open window, lost her balance, and fell thirty feet into the Thames below.</p>

<p>The fall briefly submerged her, but her dress cushioned the impact. Coming up stunned, she desperately grabbed at the riverweeds growing on one of the bridge's great stone piers. The current pulled at her dress, and the weeds were slippery. She knew she could not hold on long as the waters roared nearby, ready to sweep her through the deadly rapids beneath the bridge.</p>

<p>Above, chaos erupted. Bull struggled to remove his heavy robe, his wife gasped for breath, Silversleeves sank to his knees in prayer, and James Bull shouted for a rope while knocking over the table and crushing Gilbert Bull's precious astrolabe.</p>

<p>But Ducket "dropping the knife and ignoring Silversleeves, ran to the window and launched himself out into the air just as, below, Tiffany's fingers lost their grip. A second later he followed her, into the raging torrent."</p>

<p>Ducket successfully rescued Tiffany from the Thames, bringing her safely to shore.</p>

<h3 id='1382-marriage-and-new-life'>1382: Marriage and New Life</h3>

<p>Hours later, when Tiffany had recovered sufficiently to speak, Gilbert Bull came to her bedside and listened to her earnestly. He then apologized to Ducket: "I have thanked you for saving Tiffany's life, which you certainly did, and I do so again. But I now believe, after talking to Tiffany, that I owe you an unqualified apology for doubting your character... It seems also that my daughter is very anxious to marry you instead of that rogue Silversleeves. Her judgement is obviously better than mine."</p>

<p>Tiffany and Ducket were married one week later in a happy ceremony with Whittington standing beside the groom and Chaucer making a speech. Gilbert Bull stipulated only one condition: "Since I have no son, and you will enjoy a large fortune from me, I ask one thing: that you, Ducket, should take the name of Bull." The couple readily agreed, and Geoffrey and Tiffany Bull began their married life in the pleasant house on Oyster Hill near London Bridge that had originally been prepared for Tiffany and Silversleeves.</p>

<h3 id='1382-1386-establishing-prosperity'>1382-1386: Establishing Prosperity</h3>

<p>The early years of marriage brought Tiffany and Geoffrey great success. Working with Whittington, Geoffrey engaged in profitable trading schemes, and "between the autumn of 1385 and May 1386, the two men struck five times." By the end of this period, "Geoffrey Bull, formerly Ducket, was already a rich man in his own right."</p>

<p>In June 1386, Tiffany encouraged Geoffrey to visit the College of Arms to obtain his own coat of arms. "I wouldn't have had the nerve," Geoffrey later confessed. "We're doing this behind your father's back." But Tiffany was determined, saying "Leave Father to me."</p>

<p>The visit succeeded beyond their hopes. Impressed by Ducket's heroic rescue of Tiffany, the Earl Marshal granted him arms featuring three red ducks on a silver field with two wavy blue bands representing the Thames. The official blazon read: "Argent, two Bars Wavy Azure, between three Ducks Gules" – the arms of Ducket.</p>

<p>Most importantly, having his own coat of arms allowed Geoffrey to resume using his own name instead of Bull. Tiffany supported this change entirely: "You hate it, don't you?" she said of the name Bull. "I hate it, too." She was tired of being seen as "the girl who had married beneath her" and having friends say dismissively: "The Bulls couldn't find her a proper husband, so they fished him out of the river."</p>

<p>Geoffrey became an officer of the Grocers Guild (a remarkable achievement for someone just short of twenty-six years old) and also a counsellor for his city ward. "You realize," Tiffany delightedly told him, "that this is the first step to being an alderman?"</p>

<h3 id='1386-the-confrontation-with-father'>1386: The Confrontation with Father</h3>

<p>When Gilbert Bull returned from his time in Kent as a Justice of the Peace in July 1386, he discovered that Geoffrey had resumed using the name Ducket. His rage was volcanic. "Treachery!" he roared. "Your husband's a Judas. I was right all along. Never trust a foundling. Bad blood. You're no better though, you little Jezebel!"</p>

<p>Tiffany protested that their children would still be Bull's grandchildren, but her father was implacable: "It's the fortune of Bull you expect to inherit, not of Ducket." His most devastating charge was simply: "He broke his word."</p>

<p>Bull announced his intention to marry again "and if I have a son, it is he, and not you and Ducket, who will inherit." When Geoffrey wondered if Bull might change his mind, Tiffany revealed a harder side of her personality. Her "soft brown eyes suddenly went very hard" and she said quietly: "I don't think you quite understand how much money we're talking about."</p>

<p>Tiffany embarked on a campaign to prevent her father's remarriage. Her strategy was pragmatic: "He must either marry a woman past childbearing, or find a mistress he can't marry. Which means she must be married already." She approached multiple women, including Dame Barnikel (who refused, saying "I've got a perfectly good Bull of my own").</p>

<p>Ultimately, Tiffany's problem was solved by Whittington, who arranged for Bull to sit next to an attractive woman at a feast honoring Chaucer's election to Parliament. This woman turned out to be Sister Olive from St Helen's convent – the same woman who had once been Ducket's lover. Bull began an affair with her that lasted eight years, and "his desire for the rigours of matrimony soon left him."</p>

<h3 id='1395-1422-heiress-and-matriarch'>1395-1422: Heiress and Matriarch</h3>

<p>In 1395, both the heir to Bocton and his father died, and the beautiful Kent estate passed to Gilbert Bull. He left the house on London Bridge to Tiffany and Geoffrey and went to live at Bocton, where he remained for his final years.</p>

<p>When Gilbert Bull died in 1405, Tiffany inherited Bocton and became "a far greater heiress than even she had hoped to be." She went to the Kent estate more often than her husband, though Geoffrey came to love the place as well. The family home, however, remained the grand house on London Bridge where Tiffany had grown up.</p>

<p>By the turn of the century, the Ducket family was considered among the most fortunate in London. Tiffany and Geoffrey had seven healthy children. Her family pride was somewhat restored when the College of Arms pointed out that, as an armorial heiress, the arms of Bull and Ducket could be joined, "leaving Bull at least a heraldic immortality for future generations."</p>

<p>Tiffany lived to see her friend Whittington become mayor of London three times and build many civic improvements including a new water fountain. She witnessed her kinsman James Bull's brewery prosper and supply beer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry V</a>'s troops at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agincourt</a>. She saw England triumph once again in its old conflict with France.</p>

<p>She outlived many of the figures from her youth, including Chaucer, who died in 1400, perhaps of plague. As she aged, Tiffany watched her children grow up and grow rich, managing her considerable inheritance with the same determination she had shown as a young woman fighting for the right to choose her own husband.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='geoffrey-ducket'>Geoffrey Ducket</h3>

<p>Tiffany's relationship with Geoffrey Ducket evolved from childhood companionship to deep love and partnership. From age five, she adored the foundling boy who carried her on his shoulders, played with her, and showed her kindness. She made him promise to visit her weekly when he was apprenticed, and was hurt when those visits diminished after Silversleeves rebuked him for kissing her.</p>

<p>Her feelings crystallized during her betrothal to Silversleeves, when she gradually realized she trusted Ducket's character more than anyone else's. Her decision to investigate his accusations against Silversleeves, despite lacking evidence, showed the depth of her faith in him. When she discovered Amy Fleming also cared for Ducket, she risked everything on a desperate gamble, asking him directly: "do you love me?"</p>

<p>After their marriage, they became true partners. Geoffrey deferred to Tiffany's judgment on social and family matters (as when she pushed him to get his own coat of arms), while Tiffany supported Geoffrey's business ventures and ambitions. She demonstrated fierce loyalty when her father threatened their inheritance, showing herself to be as pragmatic and determined as her merchant father.</p>

<h3 id='gilbert-bull'>Gilbert Bull</h3>

<p>Tiffany's relationship with her father was complex and evolved significantly over her life. As a child, she was docile and obedient, and Gilbert adored her even as he mourned the lack of a son. During her adolescence, they developed an unusual closeness as he consulted her opinions on her various suitors, something rare for a medieval father and daughter.</p>

<p>The crisis over her refusal to marry Silversleeves tested their relationship to the breaking point. Bull's strike that sent her out the window was both the climax of his rage and, ultimately, the catalyst for recognizing her judgment was superior to his. After Ducket rescued her, Bull made a full apology and acknowledged: "Her judgement is obviously better than mine."</p>

<p>However, their relationship faced another severe test when Tiffany and Geoffrey resumed the Ducket name. Bull felt betrayed and threatened to remarry and disinherit them. Tiffany responded not with submission but with political maneuvering, ultimately successfully preventing his remarriage. By the time of Bull's final years at Bocton, they had reached a comfortable reconciliation, with Bull taking pleasure in his grandchildren and accepting the heraldic compromise that preserved the Bull name.</p>

<h3 id='benedict-silversleeves'>Benedict Silversleeves</h3>

<p>Tiffany's relationship with Silversleeves appeared proper and promising for several years. She found him intelligent and admirable, though she sensed something was missing. Her doubts crystallized when Ducket made accusations against him, and she chose to investigate rather than dismiss them out of hand.</p>

<p>Her rejection of Silversleeves was absolute once she learned the truth about his character. She never wavered in her conviction, even when locked in her room and threatened with a convent. Her relief at escaping the marriage was palpable: "Never mind. I never really liked him."</p>

<h3 id='amy-fleming'>Amy Fleming</h3>

<p>Though from different social classes, Tiffany formed a bond with Amy based on mutual respect and shared concern for Ducket's welfare. Tiffany approached Amy as "I've no one to turn to" and trusted her to provide honest information about Ducket's character. Amy recognized Tiffany's genuine nature despite her privileged background, and the two women worked together to uncover the truth about Silversleeves. Their conversation revealed Tiffany's lack of social prejudice and her ability to form genuine friendships across class boundaries.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Tiffany came of age during one of the most turbulent periods in English medieval history. Born in 1365, she was a child during the final years of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward III</a>'s reign and witnessed the transition to his young grandson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_II_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard II</a> in 1377.</p>

<p>The economic disruption following the Black Death shaped her world. The controversial poll tax of 1380, explained to her by Silversleeves, was an attempt by the royal council to raise revenue in new ways as traditional feudal obligations broke down. The tax sparked the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, which Tiffany witnessed firsthand from her family's house on London Bridge.</p>

<p>She lived through Richard II's troubled reign, his deposition by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry IV</a> in 1399, and the beginning of Lancastrian rule. Her long life spanned into the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry V</a> and the English triumph at Agincourt in 1415.</p>

<p>As a wealthy merchant's daughter and later a major heiress, Tiffany represented the growing power of London's mercantile elite. Her father's wealth came from the cloth trade, the backbone of England's economy. Her marriage to a foundling who became a successful merchant demonstrated the social mobility possible in late medieval London, even as it challenged traditional notions of class and lineage.</p>

<p>The importance of heraldry and coats of arms in Tiffany's story reflects the era's concern with dignity, honor, and family identity. Her support for Geoffrey's quest to establish his own heraldic identity showed how even practical merchant families participated in the symbolic language of medieval nobility.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Tiffany embodies several important themes in the novel's portrayal of medieval London life.</p>

<p><strong>Choice and Agency</strong>: Tiffany's insistence on choosing her own husband, despite enormous pressure, represents the gradual expansion of personal freedom even within traditional structures. Her father's promise – "The choice will be yours" – became the foundation for her resistance. This theme resonates throughout her life as she consistently exercised agency in managing her inheritance and family affairs.</p>

<p><strong>Class and Merit</strong>: Her marriage to a foundling challenged medieval social hierarchies. By choosing Geoffrey Ducket over Benedict Silversleeves (who had ancient lineage), Tiffany affirmed that character and merit mattered more than birth. Her journey from being mocked as someone who "married beneath her" to becoming respected as the matriarch of a prominent family illustrated the social fluidity of London's merchant class.</p>

<p><strong>Loyalty and Trust</strong>: Tiffany's faith in Ducket, even when he was accused of theft and rebellion, demonstrated the power of genuine loyalty. She investigated his character independently rather than accepting others' judgments, and this trust was vindicated. Her friendship with Amy Fleming also showed her ability to value honesty and character regardless of social position.</p>

<p><strong>Feminine Strength</strong>: While appearing to conform to feminine ideals of the time (meek, obedient, modest), Tiffany repeatedly demonstrated strategic intelligence and determination. She defied her father when necessary, investigated Silversleeves independently, maneuvered to protect her inheritance, and managed the family fortune capably. Her "soft brown eyes suddenly went very hard" when her inheritance was threatened, revealing the steel beneath her gracious exterior.</p>

<p><strong>Fortune and Family</strong>: Tiffany's story explores the importance of inheritance and family continuity in merchant society. Her father's obsession with having a male heir, his rage at losing the Bull name, and Tiffany's own fierce protection of her fortune all illustrate how wealth and family identity were intertwined. The resolution – combining the Bull and Ducket arms – symbolized a compromise between tradition and change.</p>

<p><strong>Love and Romance</strong>: Tiffany's story offers a rare medieval love match. Unlike many merchant marriages arranged purely for advantage, she married for love while also bringing financial benefit to both parties. Her questioning of her mother about whether romantic love existed, and her ultimate realization that Ducket was "the one," adds a romantic dimension to what might otherwise be a purely mercantile transaction.</p>
