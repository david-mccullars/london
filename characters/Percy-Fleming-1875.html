<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Percy Fleming is a skilled tailor who works independently making trousers for prestigious West End establishments like Tom Brown. The fourth generation descendant of <a href="characters/Jeremy-Fleming-1770.html">Jeremy Fleming</a>, a Bank of England clerk, Percy represents the Fleming family's continuation in respectable trades. His courtship of Jenny Ducket is marked by patience, determination, and eventual triumph over social barriers and medical misinformation. By the Second World War, he has established a modest but comfortable life at Crystal Palace and volunteers with his brother Herbert at a fire station during the Blitz.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Percy has "a concave face, a little sad perhaps but determined, which made him look reliable." He suffers from a persistent cough that affects his health, particularly in the London fogs. By the 1940s, he is in his mid-sixties but still active enough to volunteer during the war.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Percy is characterized by quiet determination, patience, and reliability. Unlike his theatrical brother Herbert, Percy is introspective and reserved. He tells Jenny, "I'm quieter than he is," acknowledging the contrast between himself and his more flamboyant sibling. Percy possesses a gentle, considerate nature that emerges in his careful courtship of Jenny – he never pushes too hard, respects her boundaries, and perseveres despite months of uncertainty.</p>

<p>He demonstrates artistic sensitivity and perfectionism in his work. His skill as a trouser-maker becomes so refined that Mr. Brown remarks they haven't needed to alter a single pair of his trousers even at the last fitting in over a year. Percy takes great pride in craftsmanship and shares his father's disdain for ready-made suits, believing that "A well-cut suit so perfectly fits that a man can't even feel he's got it on."</p>

<p>Percy shows romantic persistence without being overbearing. When Jenny initially turns him down, he writes three times. When she finally rejects him in person, he runs after her across Tower Bridge even as it opens, racing up two hundred steps and across the iron walkway in a desperate but futile attempt to reach her. Yet he respects her decision and stops pursuing her until Mrs. Silversleeves intervenes a year later.</p>

<p>He is also capable of strategic deception for noble ends. When he learns from Mrs. Silversleeves that Jenny cannot have children, and knowing that he himself has been told the same thing, he lies to Jenny, claiming he is the one who cannot have children. This selfless falsehood allows them both to marry without Jenny feeling she is deceiving him.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-training'>Early Life and Training</h3>

<p>Percy grew up in Soho, just east of Regent Street, where his father kept a tobacconist's shop. Through his father's connections with the tailoring trade in nearby Mayfair and Savile Row – the "golden mile" – Percy became fascinated with fine tailoring from childhood. He watched apprentices and "trotters" who carried samples, befriended cutters, and learned about the art of creating perfectly fitted suits.</p>

<p>While his brother Herbert briefly flirted with the theatre before settling as a clerk, Percy pursued his passion, convincing a master tailor at the prestigious firm of Tom Brown to take him on as an apprentice. He served a five or six year indenture, learning his craft so thoroughly that Mr. Brown offered him permanent employment at the end.</p>

<h3 id='1908-move-to-crystal-palace'>1908: Move to Crystal Palace</h3>

<p>Rather than remain as an employee, Percy chose to work independently, taking orders from Tom Brown and other tailors. This decision was influenced by Herbert's urging that he move to Crystal Palace, where Herbert lived with his wife <a href="characters/Maisie-Fleming-1878.html">Maisie Fleming</a>. The area, perched on a ridge six miles south of the Thames with magnificent views and excellent air, offered relief from Percy's worsening cough caused by London fogs. Herbert promised that the commute to the West End would be under an hour via train to Victoria Station.</p>

<p>The decision was finally made on Tower Bridge, where Herbert theatrically refused to move until Percy agreed, creating a scene that attracted bystanders – including Jenny Ducket. Herbert's performance included addressing the crowd and insisting that a "respectable" young woman shake Percy's hand as witness to his promise.</p>

<p>Percy secured lodgings on the top floor of a house on the slopes near Crystal Palace, overlooking Gipsy Hill station. He converted the large, light attic into his workroom where he could see across London to the hills of Highgate and Hampstead. Working from home allowed him to avoid daily trips to London, beneficial for his health.</p>

<h3 id='1908-1910-courtship-of-jenny'>1908-1910: Courtship of Jenny</h3>

<p>Percy's courtship of Jenny was marked by patience and persistence. They could meet at most once a week, and for the first months he was uncertain whether he had even established a friendship. Jenny would blow hot and cold – suggesting they visit the zoo one week, then claiming to be too busy for three weeks. Percy sensed "behind her studiously casual friendship, there lay a fear."</p>

<p>Their meetings always took place in central London, in "the safe and neutral zone." When Percy suggested meeting at Hampstead Heath, Jenny firmly refused, saying it was "ever such a long way to come, just for a walk." Percy understood this was about maintaining boundaries and avoiding too much commitment.</p>

<p>Progress came slowly. A turning point arrived when Jenny linked her arm in his for the first time in Hyde Park. Percy then took the bold step of inviting her to an evening at the Palladium, the huge new theatre in Piccadilly Circus offering spectacular music-hall entertainment. Jenny was animated and happy, joining in the singing. She let him kiss her on the cheek at Hampstead afterwards, and he walked all the way back to Victoria, missing the last train but lying contentedly on a bench until dawn.</p>

<p>The courtship culminated with Jenny agreeing to visit Crystal Palace for Sunday lunch with Herbert and Maisie – Percy's way of introducing her to his family and bringing her into his world.</p>

<h3 id='1910-the-proposal-and-rejection'>1910: The Proposal and Rejection</h3>

<p>The lunch at Herbert and Maisie's villa went disastrously. Maisie, protective of the family's social standing, interrogated Jenny about her background. When Jenny left with Percy, she knew she was being judged as someone "in service" – beneath them socially. Maisie pointedly noted, "We've never had anyone in service in our family, of course. Or Herbert's."</p>

<p>That same afternoon, in the park around Crystal Palace, Percy proposed marriage. Jenny responded, "I don't know, Percy. I really don't know. I need some time." When pressed, she asked to go home.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, spurred by concerns about leaving Mrs. Silversleeves, worry about her brother's children in the East End, and haunted by old Lucy's warning never to go back to poverty, Jenny met Percy at Tower Bridge and rejected him. She told him firmly, "I don't want to marry you, Percy. I never did and I never shall." She walked away before he could respond, crossing Tower Bridge just as it began to open for a ship.</p>

<p>Percy ran after her, but was stopped by a policeman as the bridge's bascules began to rise. In desperation, he raced up the two hundred steps of the southern tower, ran across the iron walkway high above, and charged down the northern tower – only to find Jenny had vanished. "There was no sign of Jenny. She had simply vanished. There was only the grim, old Tower of London behind the trees on the left, and on the right, the silent grey waters of the Thames."</p>

<p>Percy wrote to Jenny three times afterward. None of the letters was answered. As he looked out from his window across London to Hampstead, "he still felt mournful."</p>

<h3 id='1911-illness-and-reconciliation'>1911: Illness and Reconciliation</h3>

<p>By 1911, Percy's cough had worsened to the point that doctors feared tuberculosis. Though it proved not to be consumption, his doctor advised him to spend the winter somewhere warm. Despite the expense, Percy decided to take a five-month holiday in the south of France, having saved considerable money by remaining unmarried.</p>

<p>Mrs. Silversleeves, having learned about Jenny's inability to have children from the specialist Mr. Tyrrell-Ford, tracked Percy down at Tom Brown and revealed Jenny's secret to him. Soon after, Percy wrote to Jenny saying he was going away for his health but would like to see her before he left.</p>

<p>When they met at the Ivy café off Charing Cross Road, Percy explained his doctor's orders to winter in France. Then, looking at Jenny "a little oddly," he revealed his own supposed infertility: "Actually, it turns out you did better than you knew when you turned me down. When they were doing all these tests on me trying to find out what was wrong with me, they told me something else. I can get married – and all that – if you see what I mean. But it seems there won't ever be any children. No little Percys."</p>

<p>This revelation changed everything. Percy had actually lied about his infertility, having been told by Mrs. Silversleeves about Jenny's condition. His deception was motivated by love and a desire to give them both a chance at happiness.</p>

<h3 id='1912-marriage'>1912: Marriage</h3>

<p>The marriage took place in summer 1912, with Herbert officiating (though Maisie attended reluctantly), and old Mrs. Silversleeves present. At the ceremony, Jenny's name on the marriage certificate surprised Percy – it was Dogget, not Ducket as he had known her. Because of Mrs. Silversleeves, Jenny did not invite her father or brother from the East End.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, Mr. Silversleeves (the lawyer) presented them with their wedding present from his mother: a cheque for six hundred pounds. Jenny protested, "But... I can't! I mean, just for doing my job and looking after her..." But Silversleeves insisted his mother was adamant. The substantial sum allowed Percy and Jenny to buy "a little house up in Crystal Palace" with views across London to Hampstead, where Mrs. Silversleeves had been so good to Jenny.</p>

<h3 id='1913-unexpected-parenthood'>1913: Unexpected Parenthood</h3>

<p>A greater surprise came the following spring. Jenny, believing herself incapable of conception, said nothing at first when she suspected pregnancy. After another month, alarmed that something might be wrong, she consulted a doctor. When she explained it was impossible, he assured her it was not.</p>

<p>When she told Percy that night, "he first stared, then burst out laughing." Percy knew he had lied about his own ability to have children, but hadn't foreseen this outcome. Their son was born in summer 1913. The eminent Mr. Tyrrell-Ford of Harley Street, who had told Jenny she could never have children, "had been talking through his hat."</p>

<h3 id='1940-the-blitz'>1940: The Blitz</h3>

<p>By the Second World War, Percy is in his mid-sixties. His son is serving in the army, and his daughter is married and living in Kent. Though Percy is past military age, he and Herbert volunteer at a fire station substation in Crystal Palace (section 84), helping out during the Blitz.</p>

<p>Percy typically manages the kitchen at the substation, which occupies an evacuated schoolhouse equipped with four taxis with ladders, three trailer pumps, a van, and two motorcycles. The station officer has kept the Fleming brothers on partly because Herbert's piano playing – he performs music-hall songs on the old upright piano – is good for morale.</p>

<p>One memorable evening, Admiral Sir William Barnikel arrives unannounced for inspection. After Herbert plays "Nellie Dean," the admiral roars approval and orders the piano tuned. He then inspects the kitchen and discovers that the corned beef supplied for the men has gone off. Barnikel becomes furious, pounding the table so hard one leg falls off, and hurls the tray of bad meat over the station roof. He orders proper food brought from headquarters, telling Percy: "Fleming, if you are ever given food like this again, you are to pick up the telephone, ring HQ and ask for me personally. If they argue, you tell them I told you to. I'm trusting you to do that."</p>

<p>Later that night, when Auxiliary Fireman Clark falls ill and crew number three is a man short just as news comes that the Bull Brewery has been hit by a conflagration, the station officer asks Percy to go along. Though in his sixties, Percy agrees. The others joke, "It's a chance to get in the brewery. We'll have a party!" Percy survives the dangerous night, returning home at nine o'clock the following morning – only to learn that Maisie has been killed by shrapnel while watching a dogfight over Crystal Palace. Herbert insists they not tell Percy immediately: "He's been out all night and he'll feel he's got to do something. Let him sleep."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='herbert-fleming'>Herbert Fleming</h3>

<p>Percy's relationship with his brother Herbert is warm and complementary. Herbert is theatrical, flamboyant, and sociable, while Percy is quiet and reserved. Percy reflects that "His brother Herbert could be rather foolish sometimes with his clowning," but accepts it as "that was Herbert."</p>

<p>Herbert actively promotes Percy's welfare, pressing him to move to Crystal Palace for his health and even playing matchmaker. When Percy proposes but receives an ambiguous response from Jenny, Herbert advises him: "She's playing hard to get." Though Herbert's wife Maisie disapproves of Jenny at first, Herbert remains supportive of Percy's choice.</p>

<p>By the Blitz, the brothers work together at the fire station, with Herbert providing entertainment and Percy managing provisions. When Maisie is killed, the brothers share their grief together in the evening after letting Percy sleep through the day. The partnership reflects a lifetime of mutual support.</p>

<h3 id='jenny-fleming-ne-dogget'>Jenny Fleming (née Dogget)</h3>

<p>Percy's courtship of Jenny is one of persistent, patient love. From their first meeting on Tower Bridge when Herbert makes a scene, Percy is attracted to her "very nice brown eyes" and her quiet, unassuming manner. He tells her, "I'm quieter than he is," establishing common ground.</p>

<p>Their relationship unfolds slowly over nearly two years of weekly meetings in neutral locations around London. Percy respects Jenny's boundaries, never pushing when she needs space, yet never giving up entirely. When she claims to be "too busy" for three weeks, he waits. When she rejects meeting at Hampstead, he understands.</p>

<p>Percy's love is demonstrated not just through persistence but through sacrifice. When Mrs. Silversleeves reveals Jenny's secret infertility, Percy lies about his own inability to have children to remove the barrier between them. This deception is motivated entirely by love and a desire to give them both happiness.</p>

<p>After their marriage, Percy and Jenny build a comfortable life together at Crystal Palace. Jenny particularly values that "she could look right across London to the place where the old lady had been so good to her." They have two children despite medical predictions, and their home becomes a place of contentment. By 1940, after nearly three decades of marriage, they maintain the household together while Percy volunteers during the Blitz.</p>

<h3 id='maisie-fleming'>Maisie Fleming</h3>

<p>Percy's relationship with his sister-in-law Maisie is cordial but somewhat strained, particularly over Jenny. Maisie, aspiring to respectability and having inherited five hundred pounds to buy a house, sees Jenny as a potential threat to the Fleming family's social standing. At the disastrous Sunday lunch, Maisie interrogates Jenny about her family and background, ultimately discovering she is "in service."</p>

<p>Despite her initial opposition to the match, Maisie and Jenny eventually "learned to get on together" over the years. By the Blitz, the two women go to see <i>Gone with the Wind</i> together and stand in the garden watching the bombing. When Maisie is killed by shrapnel, Percy grieves the loss.</p>

<h3 id='mr-brown-and-the-tailoring-trade'>Mr. Brown and the Tailoring Trade</h3>

<p>Percy's relationship with his employer and mentor Mr. Brown reflects mutual respect based on skill and professionalism. Mr. Brown takes Percy on as an apprentice, trains him thoroughly, and at the end offers him permanent employment. When Percy chooses to work independently instead, Brown continues to use his services and acknowledges his exceptional skill: "I don't know how you do it, but in the last year we haven't needed to alter a single pair of your trousers, even at the last fitting."</p>

<p>This relationship allows Percy to achieve independence while maintaining security. Tom Brown continues to provide regular work, and Percy's reputation spreads to other fine establishments. The arrangement represents the ideal trajectory for a skilled craftsman in Edwardian London.</p>

<h3 id='admiral-sir-william-barnikel'>Admiral Sir William Barnikel</h3>

<p>Though their interaction is brief, Admiral Barnikel's visit to the fire station creates a memorable impression on Percy. The admiral's fury over the spoiled food and his personal intervention on behalf of the men demonstrates care for those under his command. His instruction to Percy to call him personally about any future problems shows trust in Percy's judgment and gives Percy a direct connection to authority – an unusual privilege for someone of his class.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Percy Fleming represents the skilled artisan class of Edwardian and early twentieth-century London. As the great-great-grandson of Jeremy Fleming, a Bank of England clerk, his family has maintained respectability across generations through skilled trades rather than advancing into the professional classes.</p>

<p>Percy's craft of tailoring places him in the heart of London's luxury trade. The "golden mile" of Mayfair and Savile Row represents the pinnacle of men's tailoring, where wealthy clients worldwide come for bespoke suits. The division of labor – coat-makers, waistcoat-makers, and trouser-makers – reflects the specialization that allowed London to maintain supremacy in this trade.</p>

<p>Percy's move to Crystal Palace reflects the suburbanization of London enabled by railways. The area, developed after the Great Exhibition's Crystal Palace was relocated there, attracted respectable working and middle-class families seeking better air and modern housing while maintaining access to central London employment. The commute to Victoria Station in under an hour made it practical for skilled workers like Percy to live away from the fog and pollution of the basin.</p>

<p>His health concerns about London fogs were well-founded. The notorious "pea-soupers" that plagued Victorian and Edwardian London killed thousands, particularly those with respiratory vulnerabilities. Percy's ability to afford a five-month winter in the south of France for his health shows both the savings possible for a successful independent craftsman and the contemporary understanding that warm, dry climates helped respiratory conditions.</p>

<p>Percy's marriage to Jenny crosses social boundaries that were significant in Edwardian England. Jenny's position "in service" placed her in a distinctly working-class role, while Percy as an independent skilled craftsman occupied a higher rung – close to lower middle class. Maisie's reaction to Jenny reflects the intense status consciousness of the period, where small differences in occupation and income determined social acceptability.</p>

<p>The wedding gift of six hundred pounds from Mrs. Silversleeves represents a substantial sum – roughly equivalent to several years' wages for a domestic servant or a skilled worker. It enables Percy and Jenny to purchase their house outright, providing security and avoiding rent. This financial foundation allows them to weather the economic uncertainties of the interwar period and raise their children comfortably.</p>

<p>During the Blitz, Percy's volunteer work with the Auxiliary Fire Service represents the mobilization of Britain's home front. Men beyond military age, like Percy and Herbert in their sixties, performed crucial civil defense roles. The fire service, despite initial teething problems and some contempt from those who saw AFS volunteers as dodging military service, proved heroic during the sustained German bombing campaign. The conversion of London taxis into fire appliances with trailer pumps illustrates the improvisation necessary to defend the capital.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Percy Fleming embodies several important themes in the novel's exploration of London across generations. His patient courtship of Jenny and ultimate triumph over medical misinformation demonstrates the persistence of human connection despite social barriers and apparent impossibilities. The revelation that both were incorrectly told they could not have children, and their subsequent parenthood, suggests that expert authority should sometimes be questioned and that hope can surprise us.</p>

<p>Percy's craftsmanship represents the continuation of London's tradition of skilled artisan trades. His perfectionism and pride in work that requires no alterations connects to centuries of guild tradition and the specialized skills that made London a center of luxury production. Yet his independence rather than employment in a large workshop reflects the changing economy of the early twentieth century.</p>

<p>The relationship between Percy and Herbert illustrates complementary temperaments within families – the quiet, steady craftsman and the theatrical, sociable clerk – both finding their place and supporting each other through life's challenges. Their work together during the Blitz shows the enduring bond between brothers.</p>

<p>Percy's move from Soho to Crystal Palace and his courtship across the Thames embody one of the novel's recurring themes: the growing division between north and south London created by bridges and railways in the nineteenth century. Jenny at Hampstead and Percy at Crystal Palace exist in "worlds apart" that can only be bridged through persistent effort. The River Thames becomes both literal barrier and symbolic divide that love must cross.</p>

<p>His life with Jenny represents successful social mobility and class-crossing in early twentieth-century London. Despite Maisie's initial disapproval and the social awkwardness of their different backgrounds, Percy and Jenny create a stable, comfortable life together. Their house at Crystal Palace with its views across London symbolizes their achievement – modest but secure, respectable and satisfying.</p>

<p>Finally, Percy's volunteer service during the Blitz in his sixties demonstrates the resilience and collective sacrifice of Londoners during their city's darkest hour. Though he manages the kitchen rather than fighting fires directly, his willingness to serve and his encounter with Admiral Barnikel's righteous fury over poor provisions illustrate the importance of every role in the total war effort.</p>
