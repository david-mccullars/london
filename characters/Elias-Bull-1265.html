<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Elias Bull is a poor weaver and the disinherited cousin of the wealthy merchant <a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a>. Ten years younger than William, Elias represents the tragic consequences of his father's political choices during the baronial rebellion under Simon de Montfort. Despite his patrician lineage, he lives in poverty and is forced to repeatedly beg his prosperous cousin for help to support his wife and children.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Elias is described as spare in build (contrasting with William's thickset frame) and fresh-faced (where William has a blotchy cheek and heavy jowl). His physical appearance reflects both his youth relative to William and likely the effects of his difficult circumstances as a struggling tradesman.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Elias appears as a humble, desperate man forced into the humiliating position of repeatedly begging his wealthier cousin for assistance. His plea to William – "Is it right that the sins of the father should be visited upon the son?" – reveals both his sense of injustice at his situation and his attempt to appeal to William's sense of family obligation. His willingness to endure William's contempt and insults demonstrates the depth of his desperation to provide for his family. The text describes him as "poor Elias Bull, much mystified" when William dismisses him with a cruel joke, suggesting a certain naivete or inability to understand the full depths of his cousin's vindictiveness.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1295-the-failed-plea'>1295: The Failed Plea</h3>

<p>By 1295, Elias has already approached his wealthy cousin <a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a> multiple times seeking financial assistance. This is noted as "the third time this year" he has come to William's house. His visits are motivated by genuine need – his occupation as a weaver brings him only a meager living, insufficient to properly support his wife and children.</p>

<p>The scene in which Elias appears takes place in William's privy, where the merchant conducts business. William greets his cousin with immediate hostility, calling him "the traitor" – not for Elias's own actions, but for his father's political choices decades earlier. Elias attempts to explain his situation, noting that their grandfather cut his father off with only a pittance, leaving Elias without the inheritance that might have been his by birth.</p>

<p>William's response is characteristically harsh. He gives Elias three marks – enough to "improve the family's meals for some time, but not enough to make the slightest change in their circumstances." Then, in a moment of particular cruelty, William tells Elias to return in a year, suggesting he might receive "the inheritance that might have been yours." This is a deliberate deception: William has just decided that the Bulls are leaving London permanently, and he knows he will not be there when Elias returns.</p>

<p>Elias departs "much mystified" by William's promise, unaware that it is merely a cruel joke at his expense.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='william-bullwilliam-bull-1255html'><a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a></h3>

<p>Elias's relationship with his cousin William is defined entirely by inequality and rejection. William views Elias not as family but as "the traitor's wretched son," holding him responsible for his father's political choices during the Montfort rebellion. Despite Elias's appeals to family obligation and his arguments that children should not suffer for their parents' decisions, William refuses any meaningful assistance. The merchant's attitude – that it is indeed right for "the sins of the father to be visited upon the son" – reveals his conviction that political loyalty trumps blood ties. William's final interaction with Elias is deliberately cruel, offering false hope while knowing the Bulls are leaving London, suggesting that William takes actual pleasure in his cousin's suffering.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Elias's poverty and disinheritance stem directly from the political upheavals of the mid-13th century during the reign of King Henry III. His father was William's father's brother, a member of the patrician Bull family. However, during Simon de Montfort's baronial rebellion and the subsequent radical takeover of London's government, Elias's father joined the rebels.</p>

<p>This was a period when solid citizens – fishmongers, skinners, traders, and craftsmen – led the ancient Folkmoot in rebellion against rich dynasts like the Bulls. The Folkmoot even deposed the patrician aldermen and elected "vulgar fellows" in their place. Though some young men from patrician families joined the rebels as idealists or opportunists, the Bulls viewed such betrayal as unforgivable. As William's father declared: "A traitor is a traitor, and that's that."</p>

<p>When Montfort was eventually killed and the old patriciate regained control of London, families like the Bulls returned to power – but Elias's father had been permanently cut off from the family. He was left with only a pittance, which meant his son Elias inherited neither wealth nor position. Instead, Elias was born into poverty despite his patrician bloodline, forced to work as a weaver and struggling to support his family.</p>

<p>By 1295, the Bulls are in retreat, facing pressure from immigrants and social changes. William's decision to leave London permanently means that even the remote possibility of future reconciliation with Elias's branch of the family is extinguished.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Elias Bull embodies the theme of inherited consequences – how political choices and family feuds can doom later generations to poverty and exclusion. His question to William – whether it is right for the sins of the father to be visited upon the son – articulates a moral dilemma that the novel explores throughout its multi-generational narrative. William's harsh answer of "Yes" reveals the unforgiving nature of family loyalty among London's patrician class.</p>

<p>Elias also represents the fragility of social status in medieval London. Despite his patrician lineage, a single generation of political misjudgment has reduced him to poverty and powerlessness. His desperate pleas to William show how family ties could be both the source of identity and the instrument of permanent exclusion.</p>

<p>Finally, Elias serves as a foil to William Bull's character, highlighting the merchant's cruelty and self-satisfaction. William's false promise to Elias – offering hope of an inheritance while knowing he will be gone – demonstrates a vindictiveness that goes beyond mere refusal to help. It reveals William's pleasure in wielding power over those who are vulnerable, even members of his own family.</p>
