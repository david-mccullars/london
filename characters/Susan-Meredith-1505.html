<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Susan Meredith was a devout Catholic woman from a Welsh family who witnessed the most turbulent period of England's religious transformation. Born into a family with Tudor connections, she married Rowland Bull and lived through the crisis of Henry VIII's break with Rome, which forced impossible choices upon her household. Her story encompasses a shocking encounter with the king, her husband's near-execution for refusing the royal supremacy, and decades of silent endurance through the religious upheavals of four successive reigns. She embodies the experience of ordinary believers caught between conscience and survival during England's Reformation.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>At twenty-eight (in 1533), Susan had pleasantly regular features, though not striking by the era's standards which preferred pale, oval faces. Her most notable feature was her hair - a dark, rich brown with warm auburn hints that gave it a lustrous sheen like polished cherry wood. Her eyes were the same warm brown color. She maintained a slim figure even after bearing four children. She typically dressed modestly but well, wearing a starched white coif with her hair neatly pinned beneath, and favoring gowns in subdued colors like pale brown silk. She wore a modest gold cross around her neck, reflecting her deep religious devotion.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Susan was fundamentally shaped by her Catholic faith and her fierce protectiveness of her family. Though devout, she was pragmatic rather than doctrinaire, capable of making difficult compromises when necessary to protect her household. She valued education highly and insisted her children - including her daughters - receive serious academic training in Latin and literature, believing that "a happy marriage is a sharing of minds as well as of other things."</p>

<p>She possessed keen observational skills and psychological insight, noticing details about people that others missed. She was reserved and disliked the falseness of court life, preferring honesty and directness. Though loyal to her family, she could be critical when she believed they were wrong - she thoroughly disliked Sir Thomas More's obsessive heresy-hunting, considering it "not English," and felt Protestant reformers displayed arrogance in demanding everyone be "perfect."</p>

<p>When faced with impossible choices, Susan demonstrated both moral courage and painful compromise. She pressured her husband to take the royal succession oath in 1534, arguing pragmatically about political necessity, yet she later gave him permission to refuse a second oath even knowing it meant his execution. This internal conflict - between conscience and survival - defined her character. Her ultimate response to these moral dilemmas was silence and discretion, becoming a witness who observed history's cruelties but kept her own counsel.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-c-1505-1523'>Early Life (c. 1505-1523)</h3>

<p>Susan was born around 1505 to a Welsh family named Meredith who had come to England with the Tudors. Her grandfather had fought at Bosworth Field for Henry Tudor in 1485. Her father died when she was young, around 1510, leaving her with two brothers: Peter, her much older half-brother from their father's first marriage, and Thomas, closer to her in age. Despite her father's death, King Henry VIII remembered the Meredith family's service and showed them favor at court.</p>

<p>At age five, her father took her to meet King Henry VIII. She remembered the magnificent figure advancing across the great hall - big, broad-chested, powerful, splendid. The king scooped her up in his tremendous arms and kissed her, and even at that age, Susan knew "surely this was everything a man could be." This childhood memory would contrast painfully with a later encounter.</p>

<h3 id='marriage-and-chelsea-years-c-1523-1533'>Marriage and Chelsea Years (c. 1523-1533)</h3>

<p>Her eldest brother Peter, who became a Catholic priest at St Lawrence Silversleeves church, introduced her to Rowland Bull, a brewer's son from Southwark with a nervous, intense constitution and deep religious devotion. Peter told Rowland simply: "This is the one." Despite Rowland's initially hesitant nature - he had considered joining holy orders - Susan took charge of their physical relationship early in their marriage, and they found great happiness together. She later confessed their marital relations to their priest "with a smile they did not see."</p>

<p>By 1533, they had four children: Jane (ten years old), Jonathan (eight), and two younger daughters. Susan was a demanding educator, requiring Jane to study Latin for three hours daily despite the girl's complaints that her friends could barely read English. Susan insisted: "I don't want you to marry an ignorant man; and believe me, a happy marriage is a sharing of minds as well as of other things."</p>

<h3 id='1533-the-garden-incident-at-hampton-court'>1533: The Garden Incident at Hampton Court</h3>

<p>In August 1533, Susan accompanied Rowland to Hampton Court, where her brother Thomas was arranging for Rowland to meet with Sir Thomas More about a position in the chancellor's household. While Rowland was inside the palace, Susan wandered into the gardens seeking solitude. Stepping past a hedge into a rose garden, she suddenly encountered a man and woman in an arbour engaged in sexual activity. To her shock, the man was King Henry VIII himself.</p>

<p>For several seconds she stood frozen, staring "idiotically" as the king, surprised in the act, turned to face her in his nakedness. Unlike the magnificent figure of her childhood memory, the forty-two-year-old Henry had "a belly that hung over his waist" and gave her "the greediest, most lecherous grin she had ever seen." Her eyes betrayed her disgust, and Henry saw it. The king's demeanor turned dangerous. "Methinks this lady has a sullen look," he said quietly, then loudly: "We do not know this lady. But we like her not!"</p>

<p>Asked her name, Susan recovered her composure enough to claim her father had been Henry's friend and assure him "I have been Your Majesty's friend all my life." But she made a critical error by saying "I saw nothing, sire" - implying the king had something to hide. She left "miserably confused" and "trembling," having discovered that "in the innermost heart of the kingdom, stripped of the pomp and pious façade, lay a hideous corruption."</p>

<p>Despite this awkward encounter, Thomas managed to salvage the situation, and Rowland received his appointment. By late summer, they moved into a charming brick and oak-beamed house in Chelsea with a pleasant garden leading to the river. This brought Susan "ease she had never known before."</p>

<h3 id='1533-1534-domestic-happiness-and-growing-doubts'>1533-1534: Domestic Happiness and Growing Doubts</h3>

<p>The Chelsea years were among the happiest of Susan's life. Rowland worked for Sir Thomas More (until More's retirement), and her brother Thomas visited frequently. The three would sit before the fire discussing religion, with Thomas displaying views that troubled Susan - he advocated for an English Bible and questioned Catholic practices. She "could not help feeling that in the reformers, and especially those who went over to Protestantism, there was a certain arrogance."</p>

<p>During these discussions, Susan articulated her moderate Catholic position: "They want everybody to be perfect. But God rewards us all for doing our best. The reformers want to force everyone to be like them and they think no one can be saved otherwise." Yet despite her theological conservatism, she thoroughly disliked their neighbor Sir Thomas More, considering him an obsessive heretic-hunter who was "not English" in his zeal.</p>

<p>During a summer river journey in 1534, Thomas revealed to Susan and Rowland that Archbishop Cranmer had a secret wife - a Lutheran pastor's daughter from Germany - whom he kept in a box when traveling. Horrified, Susan asked Thomas directly if he himself was a covert heretic. He avoided answering, and she saw him lie to her deliberately for the first time, creating a painful "moral loneliness."</p>

<h3 id='april-1534-the-succession-oath-crisis'>April 1534: The Succession Oath Crisis</h3>

<p>When Parliament passed the Act of Succession requiring all subjects to swear an oath recognizing Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn and their offspring as legitimate heirs, three men refused: Doctor Wilson, Bishop Fisher, and Sir Thomas More. Rowland, deeply influenced by More's example, considered refusing as well.</p>

<p>Thomas brought Rowland home "looking unusually solemn" and explained the situation. Susan "suddenly felt weak, but she kept calm." She argued pragmatically with Rowland: the oath concerned only succession, not faith; Parliament had enacted it; the bishops accepted it; it was necessary given the impossible position between king and Pope. She dismissed More as "a bigot" and insisted: "You must take the oath. You cannot destroy your career and family. Not for this. It isn't enough."</p>

<p>Rowland agreed, trusting her judgment. But Susan wondered: "Did she, Susan wondered, truly believe she was right? Or did instinct tell her that Fisher and More had correctly seen to the heart of the matter?" She remembered the Henry she had seen in the garden, "then swiftly put the vision out of her mind, and thought of her children instead. She could not see them hurt."</p>

<h3 id='1535-peters-return-and-the-supreme-head'>1535: Peter's Return and the Supreme Head</h3>

<p>In early 1535, Peter returned from a pilgrimage to Rome, bringing news that Henry planned to demand all religious houses swear an oath recognizing him as Supreme Head of the Church in England. Susan was horrified at the implications - "Henry's making himself the equal of God!" Peter announced he would refuse any such oath: "Either something is right, or it's wrong, my friend."</p>

<p>Peter's principled stance created an agonizing dilemma for Rowland. By March, Rowland spent hours in the crypt of St Etheldreda's Church wrestling with his conscience. He emerged having decided he would refuse the oath if asked. He came to Susan and essentially asked permission to go to his death.</p>

<p>Susan faced an impossible choice: refuse her husband and he would resent her forever, or permit him to face execution. She chose to respect his conscience: "You must do what your conscience tells you. I forbid you nothing." She turned away to hide her tears, "unable to bear seeing that she had made him happy."</p>

<h3 id='may-1535-the-trap-and-rowlands-arrest'>May 1535: The Trap and Rowland's Arrest</h3>

<p>Thomas assured Susan the danger would not materialize - Rowland would not be asked for the oath. But before dawn one morning, Thomas arrived with devastating news. King Henry had unexpectedly encountered Thomas in a garden and asked about his family, then ordered that both Rowland and Susan take the oath - with Thomas himself administering it to test his loyalty.</p>

<p>Susan spent over half an hour arguing with Thomas in urgent whispers before Rowland awoke. Thomas had doctored the oath, adding a saving clause: "As far as the Word of God allows" - permitting Catholics to disclaim improper interpretations. Reassured, Rowland took this modified oath.</p>

<p>But then Thomas Cromwell arrived unexpectedly and re-administered the true oath without the saving clause. Rowland could not accept it. Cromwell declared it treason and ordered Rowland taken to the Tower. Susan was given mere minutes to gather clothes for her husband before he was taken away.</p>

<h3 id='may-1535-peters-sacrifice'>May 1535: Peter's Sacrifice</h3>

<p>In desperation, Susan visited Peter at the Charterhouse monastery and begged him to persuade Rowland to take the oath. She blamed Peter directly: "it was your opinion he was following when he refused the oath." Peter revealed a dangerous plan: he would publicly take the oath, but the three Meredith siblings would arrange for Rowland to escape from the Tower.</p>

<p>On May 4, 1535, the three Carthusian priors were executed at Tyburn with horrific brutality - hanged, cut down alive, disemboweled, and quartered. Days later, Peter and Thomas executed their plan. They gave Rowland a sleeping draught, switched his clothes with Peter's, and smuggled him out of the Tower in the confusion. Peter took Rowland's place in the cell.</p>

<p>Peter died that night - either from an apoplexy or while Thomas was attempting to give him a mercy killing to spare him torture. Rowland woke in the Charterhouse believing himself already dead. The Tower authorities reported Rowland Bull's death, and he was officially declared deceased.</p>

<h3 id='1535-1536-grief-and-anger'>1535-1536: Grief and Anger</h3>

<p>When Thomas told Susan of Rowland's "death," she was devastated. She was particularly angry at Peter, believing that "after leading Rowland to certain death, he himself has now deserted." She told Thomas: "I do not wish to see Peter again." The depth of her anger reflected both her grief and her sense of moral abandonment - she had trusted Peter as the family's conscience, and felt he had first endangered Rowland, then failed him.</p>

<p>Thomas suggested she move from Chelsea to Rochester, away from London's painful associations. Eventually she agreed, finding "a new peace" in modest lodgings near Rochester Cathedral. Her children were happy there as well.</p>

<h3 id='1538-peters-return-and-reconciliation'>1538: Peter's Return and Reconciliation</h3>

<p>After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Peter appeared at Susan's door in Rochester. He had been in a northern monastery but was now adrift. The exact nature of their reunion is not detailed in the text, but Susan had written to him over two years earlier, indicating she was considering reconciliation. She agreed to see him, though "she had discovered that, though he did not know what he should say" - suggesting their relationship remained complicated and not fully healed.</p>

<p>More significantly, Peter brought news that would transform Susan's life: Rowland was alive. The entire death and burial had been an elaborate deception to save him.</p>

<h3 id='1538-1548-the-brown-family'>1538-1548: The Brown Family</h3>

<p>Susan married "Robert Brown," who was in reality Rowland living under an assumed identity. To neighbors, he appeared to be a former monk (technically true, as Rowland had lived in the Charterhouse) who had become a schoolmaster at Rochester's ancient school. He was described as "quiet, devoted to his wife and stepchildren, who referred to him affectionately as 'father.'" Despite his apparent contentment, he sometimes wore "a rather wistful expression which suggested that he might still secretly hanker after the life of the cloister."</p>

<p>They lived quietly and inconspicuously as the "Brown family," with Susan maintaining the fiction that she had been a pious widow who remarried. When Rowland died around 1548 (after ten years in Rochester), Susan called out his true name "Rowland" in her grief, revealing to the attending priest the secret she had kept for over a decade.</p>

<h3 id='1547-1553-edwards-protestant-reign'>1547-1553: Edward's Protestant Reign</h3>

<p>During the reign of the Protestant boy-king Edward VI, Susan was "astounded" at how far the Church moved toward Protestantism. She criticized Archbishop Cranmer's new Prayer Book and the denial of transubstantiation. When she visited St Lawrence Silversleeves, Peter's old church, she found it stripped of beauty - the rood screen burned, walls whitewashed, the altar removed, stained glass smashed. This "hurt her more" than seeing such destruction elsewhere, as it was Peter's church.</p>

<h3 id='1553-1558-marys-catholic-restoration'>1553-1558: Mary's Catholic Restoration</h3>

<p>Though Susan was a devout Catholic like Queen Mary, she judged that Mary's "nature is obstinate" and feared she would handle the restoration badly. She was proven right about Mary's poor political judgment. She felt sorry for Cranmer when he was burned as a heretic, "shrugged" at Hugh Latimer's execution (remembering he had himself been a persecutor), but was troubled by the widespread Protestant burnings. She disapproved of Mary's marriage to King Philip of Spain, feeling it made Catholics seem foreign and un-English.</p>

<h3 id='1558-1563-elizabeths-settlement'>1558-1563: Elizabeth's Settlement</h3>

<p>Susan was certain Elizabeth could never return to Rome - as a bastard herself (in Catholic eyes), she couldn't accept papal authority without delegitimizing her own reign. Susan appreciated Elizabeth's pragmatic religious settlement and called it the "Bastard child; bastard Church." She was grateful for Elizabeth's policy of not looking into people's hearts, allowing families like hers to maintain their private beliefs. When the Pope threatened Elizabeth with excommunication, Susan was irritated: "I wish he would not."</p>

<h3 id='1563-final-years-and-foxes-book-of-martyrs'>1563: Final Years and Foxe's Book of Martyrs</h3>

<p>In 1563, John Foxe published his "Book of Martyrs," which became hugely popular Protestant propaganda. Susan was drawn to "a cry of fury" by this work, which ignored Catholic martyrs like the Carthusian monks and conveniently forgot that Protestant leaders like Latimer had themselves been persecutors. She protested "'Tis a lie. And I fear it will persist."</p>

<p>Throughout these decades, Susan advised her children: "Whatever happens, keep your own counsel. Be silent." This became her guiding principle - witness history's injustices but maintain discretion and protect one's family through silence.</p>

<h3 id='final-years-raising-edmund-c-1575-1576-onwards'>Final Years: Raising Edmund (c. 1575-1576 onwards)</h3>

<p>After 1563, in her final years (when she was in her early 70s), Susan's brother Thomas married late in life to "a girl of good family and some fortune, but some small blemish on her character, Susan suspected, had prevented her getting married." The woman gave Thomas a son, then died shortly after childbirth. Not long after, Thomas himself was "not long for this world" and sent Susan a letter informing her he intended sending his infant son and heir to Rochester, "where I know you and Jonathan will look after him."</p>

<p>And so it was "in the last years of her life, that Susan found herself with a new charge, a handsome little fellow with auburn hair and, she had to confess, great charm. His name was Edmund. Sometimes, though, she wondered if he was not just a little too wild."</p>

<p>Susan died around 1576-1580, having lived through the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I, and well into Elizabeth I's reign - witnessing the complete transformation of English religion while maintaining her faith and protecting her family through silence and discretion. She spent her final years raising her brother's son with the help of her own son Jonathan.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='rowland-bull'>Rowland Bull</h3>

<p>Susan's relationship with her husband was characterized by deep love, mutual respect, and painful moral dilemmas. She recognized his "intense and nervous constitution" and his intellectual gifts, which set him apart from his brewer family. Though he initially considered holy orders, she encouraged their physical relationship and found great happiness in their marriage, later boasting it "could hardly be bettered."</p>

<p>Their relationship was tested by the religious crises of Henry's reign. Susan twice faced impossible choices about Rowland's conscience versus his survival. In 1534, she pressured him to take the Succession Oath, arguing pragmatically despite her own doubts. In 1535, she gave him permission to refuse the Supreme Head oath even knowing it meant his execution, telling him: "You must do what your conscience tells you. I forbid you nothing."</p>

<p>When she believed Rowland had died in the Tower, she was devastated. His secret survival and return transformed her life again - they lived as "Robert and Susan Brown" in Rochester, maintaining an elaborate fiction for over a decade. After his death around 1548, she called out his true name in grief, revealing to a priest the secret she had guarded for years. Her loyalty to Rowland, both in life and after his official "death," defined much of her existence.</p>

<h3 id='peter-meredith'>Peter Meredith</h3>

<p>Susan's relationship with her eldest half-brother was complex and evolved dramatically over time. Peter was her spiritual anchor - a devout Catholic priest who represented the family's conscience. He introduced her to Rowland with the simple declaration "This is the one," giving her the gift of her husband. She trusted Peter's moral judgment implicitly.</p>

<p>But Peter's principled refusal to compromise created terrible consequences for the family. When Rowland decided to follow Peter's example and refuse the Supreme Head oath, Susan blamed Peter directly: "it was your opinion he was following when he refused the oath." After Rowland's apparent death, she was furious at Peter, believing he had "led Rowland to certain death" then deserted them by taking the oath himself. She told Thomas: "I do not wish to see Peter again."</p>

<p>Only gradually did Susan learn the truth: Peter had sacrificed everything - his principles by publicly taking the oath, and ultimately his life by taking Rowland's place in the Tower so Rowland could escape. This sacrifice was so profound Susan struggled to process it. When Peter appeared at her door in 1538, she had been considering reconciliation for two years, yet "she had discovered that, though he did not know what he should say" - their relationship remained wounded. She eventually reconciled with him, but the text suggests their bond was never fully restored to its earlier closeness. The wound Peter's sacrifice had inflicted - both its necessity and its cost - was perhaps too deep to completely heal.</p>

<h3 id='thomas-meredith'>Thomas Meredith</h3>

<p>Susan's relationship with her younger brother Thomas was marked by affection, admiration, and growing moral distance. She found him "hard not to like" - slim, handsome, charming, witty, intelligent. He was the family's worldly hope, serving as secretary to Thomas Cromwell and moving easily in court circles. Thomas visited frequently during the Chelsea years, and Susan enjoyed his company, "admiring his intelligence when he discussed his life at court."</p>

<p>But she also sensed something troubling beneath his charm. She noticed his worldliness and suspected his faith was shallow. When he revealed Cranmer's secret Lutheran wife and she asked if he himself was a heretic, he lied to her - the first time she had seen him deliberately deceive her. She felt "moral loneliness" and pain at realizing she could no longer fully trust her brother.</p>

<p>Thomas's role in the oath crisis was ambiguous and morally complicated. He administered a doctored oath to Rowland, trying to save him, but this triggered Cromwell's intervention and Rowland's arrest. Thomas then participated in the dangerous plan to smuggle Rowland out of the Tower. Susan remained "grateful for his help in saving Rowland's life, despite his role in causing the crisis." She trusted him ultimately to protect her family, even as she recognized his compromised position.</p>

<p>In his final years (around 1574-1576, when Thomas was about 68 years old), he married late to a woman with "some small blemish on her character" and had a son named <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund</a>. After his wife died in childbirth and Thomas himself was dying, he asked Susan (then in her early 70s) to care for the infant. Susan took in her nephew and raised him with the help of her son Jonathan, though she worried Edmund was "just a little too wild." Her relationship with Thomas endured despite their religious differences - a testament to family loyalty transcending theological divides.</p>

<h3 id='king-henry-viii'>King Henry VIII</h3>

<p>Susan's relationship with King Henry was defined by two encounters separated by nearly three decades of memory. As a five-year-old child, she met the magnificent young king who scooped her up in his arms and kissed her - the embodiment of royal splendor and masculine power. "Even at her age, Susan knew that surely this was everything a man could be."</p>

<p>The 1533 garden encounter at Hampton Court shattered this idealized image. She encountered the forty-two-year-old Henry engaged in an adulterous liaison, saw him naked with his "belly that hung over his waist," and witnessed his "greediest, most lecherous grin." Her instinctive disgust was visible, and Henry saw it. His dangerous proclamation - "We like her not!" - marked her as someone who had seen too much.</p>

<p>This chance encounter set in motion the chain of events that led to Rowland's near-execution. The king, having marked the Meredith family as potentially disloyal, later tested Thomas by demanding Rowland take the oath. Susan carried the knowledge of the king's corruption for the rest of her life, her childhood illusion permanently destroyed. She realized that "in the innermost heart of the kingdom, stripped of the pomp and pious façade, lay a hideous corruption."</p>

<h3 id='her-children'>Her Children</h3>

<p>Susan was a devoted and demanding mother. She insisted on rigorous education for all her children, including her daughters - unusual for the time. She made Jane study Latin for three hours daily despite the girl's complaints, insisting: "I don't want you to marry an ignorant man; and believe me, a happy marriage is a sharing of minds as well as of other things." She valued intellectual partnership in marriage and wanted to prepare her daughters for such relationships.</p>

<p>She was protective of all four children, and her decision to pressure Rowland to take the Succession Oath in 1534 was driven by her determination to shield them from harm. "She could not see them hurt," the text notes. When Rowland was arrested and their world collapsed, she moved the family to Rochester to provide them with stability and a fresh start.</p>

<p>In her later years, she advised her children: "Whatever happens, keep your own counsel. Be silent." This wisdom - learned through painful experience - was perhaps her most important legacy to them: how to survive with integrity when the world demands impossible choices.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Susan Meredith's life (c. 1505-1563) spanned one of the most turbulent periods in English history - the break with Rome and the successive religious transformations under four monarchs. Her family's Welsh origins and Tudor connections placed them in a precarious position during these upheavals. The Merediths had fought for Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field in 1485, establishing a bond of loyalty that King Henry VIII remembered - but this very connection made them vulnerable when religious politics shifted.</p>

<p>The 1530s crisis that engulfed Susan's family reflected the impossible position of educated, devout Catholics during Henry's break with Rome. Unlike the Protestant reformers or the crypto-Lutherans in Cromwell's circle, and unlike the few who martyred themselves like Thomas More and John Fisher, most English Catholics tried to navigate a middle path. They sympathized with Henry's political difficulties, hoped the breach with Rome was temporary, and sought formulas of compromise that would preserve both their souls and their lives.</p>

<p>Susan's pragmatic advice to Rowland in 1534 - that the Succession Oath was merely political, not theological - represented the mainstream Catholic response. Most English people took the oath without qualm. But the 1535 Act of Supremacy made compromise far more difficult by declaring Henry "Supreme Head of the Church of England" - a theological claim that appeared to usurp papal authority and elevate the king to quasi-divine status. This was the oath that Peter and Rowland could not take.</p>

<p>The savage execution of the Carthusian monks in May 1535 - hanged, disemboweled alive, and quartered - inaugurated a decade of terror that forced English Catholics to choose between martyrdom, exile, conformity, or deception. Susan's family chose deception: Peter publicly took the oath he privately rejected, Rowland "died" and lived under a false identity, Thomas served in the regime while secretly sympathizing with reform, and Susan herself maintained outward conformity while preserving inner faith.</p>

<p>The successive reigns Susan lived through - Edward VI's aggressive Protestantism (1547-1553), Mary I's violent Catholic restoration (1553-1558), and Elizabeth I's pragmatic via media (1558-1603) - forced ordinary believers to repeatedly conform to contradictory religious settlements. Susan witnessed churches stripped of their beauty under Edward, then restored under Mary, then stripped again under Elizabeth. Each shift brought new dangers, new tests of conscience, new demands for conformity.</p>

<p>Susan's response - "keep your own counsel, be silent" - became a survival strategy for English Catholics who would spend the next century as a suspect minority in their own country. Elizabeth's statement that she "would not make windows into men's hearts" allowed families like Susan's to maintain private beliefs while conforming publicly - a compromise that prevented civil war but required constant vigilance and moral compromise.</p>

<p>The publication of Foxe's "Book of Martyrs" in 1563, shortly before Susan's death, represented the Protestant appropriation of martyrdom narratives. Susan's fury at this work - "'Tis a lie. And I fear it will persist" - reflected her knowledge that Catholic martyrs like Peter and the Carthusian monks would be written out of English memory. Her fear proved prescient: Foxe's work became one of the most influential books in English history, shaping Protestant identity for centuries while erasing Catholic suffering from the national narrative.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Susan Meredith embodies several crucial themes in Rutherford's <em>London</em>:</p>

<p><strong>Conscience Versus Survival</strong>: Susan's story explores the impossible moral choices faced by ordinary people during religious persecution. Her two decisions about Rowland's oaths - first pressuring him to compromise in 1534, then permitting him to face death in 1535 - illustrate the agonizing tension between protecting one's family and preserving one's soul. Neither choice was clearly right or wrong; both required sacrifices that haunted her.</p>

<p><strong>The Cost of Witness</strong>: Susan became a witness to history's cruelties - Henry's corruption, the Carthusian martyrs' brutal deaths, Peter's sacrifice, the successive religious transformations. Her response was silence and discretion, keeping counsel while observing injustice. This represents a form of resistance different from martyrdom: the determination to remember truth even when one cannot speak it openly.</p>

<p><strong>The Illusion of Power</strong>: Susan's childhood encounter with the magnificent King Henry and her adult discovery of his corruption parallels England's own disillusionment. The splendid façade of royal authority concealed moral bankruptcy. This recognition - that "in the innermost heart of the kingdom" lay "hideous corruption" - shaped Susan's understanding of all subsequent events.</p>

<p><strong>Family Loyalty Across Divides</strong>: Susan maintained relationships with family members across the religious spectrum: Peter the orthodox Catholic martyr, Thomas the crypto-Protestant courtier, Rowland the conscience-driven resister. Her ability to love and support them despite their different choices illustrates how families navigated religious divisions that might otherwise have torn them apart.</p>

<p><strong>Women's Limited Agency</strong>: Susan's power was largely confined to the domestic sphere and to moral influence over her husband. Yet within these constraints, she wielded real authority - pressuring Rowland to compromise, permitting him to resist, educating her daughters, preserving family secrets. Her insistence that her daughters receive serious education reflected her understanding that intellectual partnership could give women greater influence in marriage.</p>

<p><strong>The Politics of Memory</strong>: Susan's fury at Foxe's "Book of Martyrs" highlights how history is written by victors. She knew the truth about Catholic martyrs and Protestant persecutors, but feared - correctly - that this truth would be erased from memory. Her own story, like Peter's sacrifice, would be lost to history because it complicated the triumphalist Protestant narrative.</p>

<p><strong>Survival Through Adaptation</strong>: Susan lived through four radically different religious regimes by adapting externally while maintaining internal constancy. Her advice to "keep your own counsel, be silent" was neither cowardice nor cynicism but a pragmatic strategy for preserving faith and family in dangerous times. She represents the ordinary believers whose quiet compromises and hidden loyalties sustained Catholicism through centuries of persecution.</p>

<p>In the larger narrative of <em>London</em>, Susan represents continuity through change - the family bonds and private faiths that persisted beneath the surface turmoil of public history. Her life demonstrates that the grand political narratives of the Reformation were experienced by real people as a series of impossible moral choices, each requiring painful sacrifices with no clear right answers.</p>
