<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Sarah Bull is a young archaeologist and recent recruit to the Museum of London in 1997. A blue-eyed blonde and archaeology graduate, she works under <a href="characters/John-Dogget-1968.html">Dr John Dogget</a> on excavations in the City. Though her family owns a large brewery and she is cousin to Sir Eugene Penny, she keeps this background secret from her colleagues, preferring to be known for her work rather than her wealth and connections.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Sarah is described as a blue-eyed blonde. No other physical details are provided in the text.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Sarah is passionate about archaeology and dedicated to her work at the Museum of London. She is drawn to the scholarly rigor behind the museum's exhibits and the constant stream of new discoveries being made in London's archaeological record. Her enthusiasm for the field is genuine - she "particularly wanted to join this one" excavation because it was being conducted by Dr Dogget.</p>

<p>Despite coming from a wealthy family that owns a large brewery, Sarah prefers to keep this background hidden from her colleagues at the museum. This suggests a desire to be judged on her own merits as an archaeologist rather than on her family connections or social status. She maintains her privacy carefully: "No one at the museum had any idea that her family owned a large brewery, and certainly not that Sir Eugene Penny, alderman, was her cousin. She preferred it that way."</p>

<p>Sarah is also romantically interested in Dr John Dogget, wondering hopefully whether "as well as Roman artefacts, did he also like blue-eyed blondes?" As a new and junior recruit, she hopes that working on this dig might give him the opportunity to notice her for the first time.</p>

<p>She has an appreciation for the deeper meaning of archaeological work, resonating strongly with Dr Dogget's poetic description of excavation as "prising open" compressed layers of human lives and opening "windows, hidden in the ground."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='spring-1997-the-river-excavation'>Spring 1997: The River Excavation</h3>

<p>Sarah is working on an archaeological dig in the City of London, part of a Museum of London excavation on a small site overlooking the Thames. The excavation is taking place where a demolished building is being replaced. The site offers a rare opportunity to dig in the City, and the new building's owners have agreed that if anything significant is uncovered, they will construct an atrium and build around it so the remains can be viewed by the public.</p>

<p>The excavation has already gone down ten feet below the old basement, meaning that at the bottom of the trench, Sarah is looking at a layer of gravel that would have been the surface in the time of Julius Caesar.</p>

<p>On a bright spring afternoon in mid-May, a deputation headed by her cousin Sir Eugene Penny arrives to inspect the site. Sir Eugene is chairman of Penny Insurance Company, member of numerous boards, and an alderman of London. He has recently become interested in the Museum of London after being impressed by their exhibitions on the Huguenots and "The Peopling of London."</p>

<p>When Sir Eugene is introduced to Sarah, he shakes hands politely but pays no further attention to her, maintaining the fiction that they don't know each other. Sarah observes that "the museum, like all such institutions, was always short of funds for its ambitious projects and if anyone was likely to find a way of getting them, she thought it was probably her cousin."</p>

<p>After the deputation leaves, Sarah takes a moment to walk by the quiet, clean Thames. She notes that the river is cleaner than it has been for centuries - you can even catch fish in it again - and is carefully managed with a flood barrier to control water levels. She takes in the view down to Tower Bridge and up to St Paul's before returning to the trench.</p>

<p>The chapter ends with Sarah in the quiet trench, having heard Dr Dogget's talk about archaeological work as opening windows into compressed layers of human lives. Standing at the level where Julius Caesar might have stood, "she reached out her hand, and touched."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='dr-john-dogget'>Dr John Dogget</h3>

<p>Sarah works under Dr Dogget at the Museum of London and has romantic feelings for him. She describes him as having a "cheerful temper" and notes his distinctive white flash in his hair, which makes him "popular as he was easily recognized." She also notes his webbed fingers, which he wryly explains are "Good for swimming and digging."</p>

<p>As a new and junior recruit, Sarah feels that Dr Dogget is "always so busy" and that she is "of course so junior," but she hopes that working on this excavation might give him the opportunity to notice her for the first time. She has admired a talk he gave to schoolchildren about the deeper meaning of archaeological work, finding his poetic description of excavation as opening "windows, hidden in the ground" particularly moving.</p>

<h3 id='sir-eugene-penny'>Sir Eugene Penny</h3>

<p>Sarah's cousin, though she keeps this relationship secret from her colleagues. When he visits the excavation site as part of an official deputation, they maintain a pretense of being strangers, with Sir Eugene shaking hands politely and paying no further attention to her. Sarah recognizes his potential value to the museum as someone who might help secure funding for their ambitious projects.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Sarah lives and works in London in 1997, a time when the city is experiencing both archaeological renaissance and cultural transformation. The Museum of London, where she works, is at the forefront of revealing London's multilayered history through exhibitions like "The Peopling of London," which demonstrates that London has always been "a city of large numbers of aliens who quickly assimilated" - essentially "a melting pot" throughout its history.</p>

<p>The archaeological work Sarah participates in is part of an ongoing process of discovery in London. The devastation of the Blitz during World War II, followed by decades of rebuilding and redevelopment, has created numerous opportunities for excavation. Recent major discoveries include the Temple of Mithras, the realization that the Guildhall stands on a huge Roman amphitheatre, and countless smaller finds like the Roman forger's coins and moulds found near the old wall.</p>

<p>The London of 1997 is also a cleaner, more carefully managed city than in previous centuries. The Thames is cleaner than it has been for hundreds of years - fish can be caught in it again - and is protected by an elegant flood barrier against the gradual tilting of the island that had been raising water levels for centuries.</p>

<p>Sarah's generation at work represents a new, multicultural London. As Sir Eugene Penny observes about the young generation in their twenties at his insurance company: "they all - black, white, Asian - not only talked with the local accents of London, but had taken on the same sports, the same attitudes, even the same irreverent cockney humour as the London folk he had known as a child."</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Sarah Bull represents the culmination of the novel's exploration of London's deep history. As the final named character in a book spanning over two millennia, she literally touches the past - reaching down to the level where Julius Caesar stood, connecting the present moment to the ancient beginning.</p>

<p>Her work as an archaeologist embodies one of the novel's central themes: that London is built upon compressed layers of human lives, each era leaving traces that can be uncovered and understood. She resonates with Dr Dogget's poetic vision of archaeological work as opening "windows, hidden in the ground" - revealing individual days, individual lives, from the vast compression of time beneath London's streets.</p>

<p>Sarah also represents continuity. As a descendant of the Bull family line (through <a href="characters/Violet-Bull-1889.html">Violet Bull</a>), she carries forward one of the novel's oldest family threads, connecting the Saxon traders of the 6th century to the modern era. Yet she chooses to define herself by her work rather than her family name or wealth, suggesting that in modern London, individual merit and personal passion matter more than ancient lineage.</p>

<p>The fact that she keeps her family connections secret mirrors a broader theme in the chapter: that London's identity is not about blood or ancestry but about being a Londoner - "someone who lives here." Her colleague Dr Dogget, proud grandson of a Blitz fireman, and Sir Eugene Penny, descended from Huguenot refugees, together represent a London that has always been, as Sir Eugene puts it, "quite simply, a nation of European immigrants with new graftings being added all the time. A genetic river, if you like, fed by any number of streams."</p>

<p>The novel ends with Sarah's gesture - reaching out to touch the ancient ground - suggesting that understanding and connecting with London's layered past is what truly makes one a Londoner, regardless of whether one's family has been there for centuries or arrived yesterday.</p>
