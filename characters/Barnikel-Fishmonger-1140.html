<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Barnikel is a prosperous fishmonger in London who represents the merchant class below the wealthy wholesale traders. He is best known for his fishing nets in the Thames that damaged <a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Sampson Bull</a>'s ship and for being the brother of <a href="characters/Sister-Mabel-Barnikel-1148.html">Sister Mabel Barnikel</a>. His family gives their surname to Adam, who becomes known as <a href="characters/Adam-1187.html">Adam Ducket</a>.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>He is described as a red-haired fishmonger with a stout build, indicating the characteristic red hair of the Danish Barnikel family line.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Barnikel is a reasonable and fair-minded man who operates within the established commercial systems of his time. When confronted by <a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Sampson Bull</a> about his nets fouling Bull's ship, he responds calmly and logically, pointing out that he had paid the Constable of the Tower a considerable sum for the right to fish in that location. This demonstrates his willingness to follow proper procedures and his understanding of commercial rights.</p>

<p>He shows kindness and loyalty to those in need, taking in young Adam (the infant son of Simon the armourer) at his sister Mabel's request and raising the boy alongside his own children. The family gives the boy the affectionate nickname "little duck" or "ducket" because of his webbed hands and white tuft of hair, which eventually becomes his surname.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1170-the-kiddles-incident'>1170: The Kiddles Incident</h3>

<p>Barnikel operates fishing nets in the Thames, having paid a fortune to the Constable of the Tower for the fishing rights. These nets, known as kiddles, are part of a widespread system that clutters the river and frequently damages ships. When Alderman <a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Sampson Bull</a>'s cog becomes fouled in Barnikel's nets, breaking its rudder and delaying the voyage, Bull confronts him at the wharf. Barnikel responds reasonably, expressing sympathy for Bull's loss while pointing out that he had paid properly for the fishing rights. Bull, though furious about the system, cannot argue with this logic.</p>

<h3 id='raising-adam'>Raising Adam</h3>

<p>When Simon the armourer dies suddenly, leaving a widow and infant son, <a href="characters/Sister-Mabel-Barnikel-1148.html">Sister Mabel</a> brings the child to Barnikel's house as a playmate for his own young children. The family adopts the boy into their household, and Adam grows up among the Barnikel children. The family gives him the affectionate nickname that becomes his surname - "ducket" - from the combination of his webbed hands and white tuft of hair.</p>

<h3 id='1190-prince-johns-london'>1190: Prince John's London</h3>

<p>By April 1190, Barnikel's daughter Lucy is of marriageable age and engaged to marry Adam Ducket in the spring. However, when <a href="characters/Pentecost-Silversleeves-1145.html">Pentecost Silversleeves</a> successfully brings a case proving that Adam is legally a serf, the marriage is cancelled.</p>

<p>Barnikel stands by Adam in the Guildhall when he faces the mayor and aldermen, supporting him as the accusation is made. After Adam is stripped of his citizenship and his right to practice as a fishmonger, Barnikel promises to help him. However, he cannot go against London's customs - his sister Mabel sadly informs Adam that Lucy cannot marry a non-citizen.</p>

<h3 id='later-years'>Later Years</h3>

<p>Around this same period, Barnikel's fishing nets are once again at issue when <a href="characters/Pentecost-Silversleeves-1145.html">Pentecost Silversleeves</a>, now allied with the powerful <a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Sampson Bull</a>, arranges for their removal from the Thames. Despite having paid handsomely for the right to have them there, no compensation is offered. His sister Mabel protests that this represents one law for the rich and one for the poor, but Silversleeves openly agrees that this is indeed the case.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='sister-mabel-barnikel'>Sister Mabel Barnikel</h3>

<p>His sister is a lay sister at St Bartholomew's Hospital, known for her strong religious convictions and her care for the sick. She often visits his household, especially to see young Adam, whom she has virtually adopted as her own. They share the characteristic red hair of the Barnikel family.</p>

<h3 id='adam-ducket'>Adam Ducket</h3>

<p>Though not a blood relative, Barnikel raises Adam from infancy alongside his own children after the boy's father dies. The family embraces Adam fully, giving him the affectionate nickname that becomes his surname. Years later, Barnikel plans for Adam to marry his daughter Lucy, showing his acceptance of Adam as family. He supports Adam during his trial and promises to help him afterward, though he cannot overcome the barrier of Adam's lost citizenship.</p>

<h3 id='sampson-bull'>Sampson Bull</h3>

<p>Their relationship begins antagonistically when Barnikel's fishing nets damage Bull's ship in 1170. Though Barnikel's response is reasonable at the time, by 1190 Bull has become powerful enough to have Barnikel's nets removed without compensation through his influence with Silversleeves.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Barnikel represents the decline of the old Danish families of London since the Norman Conquest. Once powerful in Viking days, the Barnikels have been pushed steadily aside by incoming merchants from Normandy and the growing network of German Hanseatic ports. As a fishmonger, Barnikel occupies a position similar to the richer craftsmen but far below that of wholesale merchants like Bull and Silversleeves.</p>

<p>The kiddles system that Barnikel participates in exemplifies the corruption of the time - fishing rights in the Thames belonged to the Constable of the Tower, who cynically let them for maximum profit, cluttering the river with nets, weirs, booms and traps that frequently damaged ships. Though London's merchants constantly complained about the damage to shipping, the powerful interests controlling the system ensured it remained in place.</p>

<p>Barnikel's story also illustrates the rigid social stratification of medieval London, where citizenship was a precious commodity and marriage alliances were determined by social status. When Adam loses his citizenship, even Barnikel's familial loyalty cannot overcome the social prohibition against his daughter marrying a non-citizen.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Barnikel embodies the fate of London's old Danish families - respectable and prosperous, but no longer holding the power and influence they once commanded. His reasonable but ultimately futile protest against the removal of his fishing nets demonstrates the powerlessness of the middling sort against the truly wealthy and connected.</p>

<p>His role in giving Adam the surname "Ducket" represents an act of genuine familial warmth in an otherwise harsh commercial world. Yet this same warmth has its limits - when social conventions demand it, even Barnikel's family must reject Adam.</p>

<p>The contrast between his treatment by the established power structure and that of the wealthy merchants like Bull highlights the economic inequality of medieval London, where influence and connections mattered far more than fairness or proper procedure.</p>
