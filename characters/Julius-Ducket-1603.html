<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Julius Ducket, 1st Earl of St James, was the third son of <a href="characters/Jacob-Ducket-1570.html">Sir Jacob Ducket</a>, born on the very day Queen Elizabeth I died in March 1603. A staunch Royalist and Protestant merchant, Julius lived through nearly the entire seventeenth century, witnessing the Gunpowder Plot, the English Civil War, the execution of Charles I, Cromwell's Commonwealth, the Restoration, the Great Plague, the Great Fire of London, and the Glorious Revolution. His unwavering loyalty to the Stuart monarchy earned him a knighthood, and later an earldom, though his principles were tested by the treacherous secret dealings of Charles II with Catholic France.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>As a young man in the cavalier style of the 1630s, Julius wore his hair long with a moustache and beard elegantly curled, dressed in a richly slashed doublet and breeches with a huge-brimmed hat sporting a great curling ostrich feather. His wife found him uncommonly handsome in this attire.</p>

<p>In his seventies, after being made an earl in 1679, he adopted the fashionable large grey wig with tightly rolled curls that fell to the shoulders, imitating the style of the French court.</p>

<p>In old age, he became stooped with a rheumy eye and walked painfully with a stick due to arthritis. By his eighties, he had acquired the same stiff dignity that had characterized his father, Alderman Ducket. He lived to ninety-one, and in his final year walked with great difficulty though his mind remained keen.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Julius was molded by his father's strict Protestant principles and developed into a man of absolute loyalty and unwavering principles. His father taught him three fundamental lessons: the importance of order and hierarchy, remembering the Gunpowder Plot ("No popery"), and that one's word must be sacred. These principles guided his entire life.</p>

<p>As a boy, Julius was eager, willing, and boisterous in his devotion to Protestant causes, crying out "No popery!" and "God save the king!" so enthusiastically that even his stern father was amused. He had a natural aptitude for business, displaying a head for figures and a fascination with the Virginia Company and the Royal Exchange.</p>

<p>Julius possessed remarkable integrity regarding promises and trust. When his father entrusted him with the knowledge of Black Barnikel's treasure chest, Julius internalized the lesson about keeping one's word absolutely - a principle that would shape his life. His personal oath to Charles I to support his sons became the defining commitment of his existence, maintained through decades of hardship and political upheaval.</p>

<p>However, Julius's character had a ruthless practical streak. He shot Richard Meredith's dog Ned during the plague, believing he was doing his friend a necessary service by removing a source of contagion. More significantly, when Jane Wheeler presented legitimate documentation proving her claim to Black Barnikel's treasure, Julius lied, denied knowledge of the chest, and ultimately destroyed it to preserve his family's recovery from financial ruin - a betrayal of his stated principles about keeping one's word.</p>

<p>In his final decades, Julius demonstrated political flexibility and growth. After discovering Charles II's secret treaty with Catholic France - a profound betrayal of everything Julius believed in - he began voting with the Whigs, concluding that kings should be subject to Parliament. This represented a significant evolution from his earlier absolutist Royalist position, though he characteristically kept the king's treachery secret to avoid further harm to the nation.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1603-birth'>1603: Birth</h3>

<p>Julius was born in March 1603, on the very day Queen Elizabeth I died and James I succeeded to the throne. He was the ninth child and third son of <a href="characters/Jacob-Ducket-1570.html">Jacob Ducket</a>, a wealthy Mercer and future alderman. His father, who had a taste for the classics, named him after Julius Caesar, declaring: "No curse, my little son, shall ever attach itself to thee."</p>

<p>A month later, his father received a knighthood while riding out with the mayor to greet the new king.</p>

<h3 id='1605-1611-childhood-education'>1605-1611: Childhood Education</h3>

<p>Julius grew up in the substantial house behind St Mary-le-Bow, learning his father's strict Protestant principles. After the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, he witnessed executions in St Paul's churchyard and learned to chant "Remember, remember, the Fifth of November," absorbing his father's firm instruction: "No popery, Julius. The papists are the enemy within."</p>

<p>Julius proved an exceptional student, far surpassing his siblings in diligence and enthusiasm. By age four he would cry "No popery!" or "God save the king!" so boisterously that even stern Sir Jacob was amused. His father would take him on walks through Cheapside to the Mercers' Hall and the Royal Exchange, teaching him about the great trading ventures - the Levant Company, Muscovy Company, Guinea Company, and East India Company. Julius became particularly fascinated with the Virginia Company, understanding it as "a place for good Protestants" and grasping that one could serve God in commerce as much as in church.</p>

<p>Around age eight, Julius discovered Black Barnikel's treasure chest in the cellar, secured with three great padlocks and crossed with brass bands. His father explained that the pirate Orlando Barnikel had entrusted it to him years before. Sir Jacob taught Julius a crucial lesson: "Your word must be sacred, Julius. Never forget." And Julius never did - at least in principle.</p>

<h3 id='1613-1620-coming-of-age'>1613-1620: Coming of Age</h3>

<p>At age twelve, Julius witnessed the arrival of Pocahontas at the Mercers' Hall and heard <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a> preach a stirring sermon promoting Virginia settlement. In a pivotal moment during a vestry meeting, young Julius cleverly intervened to save Meredith's position by asking if the king had spoken for him - displaying early political instincts.</p>

<p>A significant event occurred when Julius innocently mentioned seeing the Dogget family with their distinctive white hair flashes and webbed hands. His father reacted with such terror and loathing that Julius was left mystified. Sir Jacob forbade him from associating with the Doggets or <a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha Carpenter</a>, calling them all "accursed." This mysterious incident led to Sir Jacob suffering a stroke shortly after, when he learned the Doggets had returned to London despite his having paid them to leave.</p>

<p>Julius's life changed dramatically in 1620 when his father's stroke left the patriarch paralyzed and speechless. Though Julius had expected to attend Oxford, his elder brother <a href="characters/Henry-Ducket-1600.html">Henry Ducket</a> informed him: "Young brother, I need you. I can't do all this alone." Julius took charge of the everyday accounting and shipping arrangements, proving himself capable with figures and business management.</p>

<p>He watched with admiration as Henry displayed style and genius in making powerful friends at court and in business. Henry's social connections brought lucrative contracts, including one from the Duke of Buckingham himself. Julius was awed by his brother's elegant sophistication and proud to be part of such a fine family.</p>

<h3 id='1630s-marriage-and-business'>1630s: Marriage and Business</h3>

<p>Julius married a cheerful, blue-eyed girl from a similar merchant family, and they had several children. Henry, still unmarried, suggested they occupy the family's big house behind Mary-le-Bow. These were happy years for Julius. He adopted the fashionable cavalier style with long hair, curled moustache and beard, and a great feathered hat - looking so well that his wife would laugh and tickle his ribs.</p>

<p>The family business continued to prosper under the brothers' management, with Henry's hop-gardens at Bocton providing steady income even when trade was poor.</p>

<h3 id='1638-the-vestry-meeting'>1638: The Vestry Meeting</h3>

<p>When <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a> departed from the prescribed Prayer Book service, Julius attempted to assert his authority as head of the vestry committee. He was interrupted by <a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1606.html">Gideon Carpenter</a>, who arrived with armed men and delivered shocking news: Henry was dead, making Julius the new Sir Julius Ducket - and he was under arrest.</p>

<h3 id='1643-1649-the-civil-war-years'>1643-1649: The Civil War Years</h3>

<p>Julius was imprisoned with three dozen other prominent Royalist citizens, labeled as "Malignants." When his wife finally gained permission to visit, Julius learned his property at Bocton had been confiscated. After months of detention, he was brought before Roundhead officers at the Guildhall and offered freedom for a price: twenty thousand pounds. Though Julius protested this would ruin him, he was forced to pay.</p>

<p>Returning home in early 1644, Julius faced destitution. The fine had consumed almost all his assets. With trade at a standstill and the city under siege conditions, Julius and his family faced three gloomy weeks of poverty and uncertainty.</p>

<p>Then Julius remembered Black Barnikel's treasure chest in the cellar. Opening it, he found it bursting with gold and silver coins of every kind - Spanish doubloons, heavy dollars from the Low Countries, English shillings. The treasure was worth many thousands of pounds and saved the family from ruin.</p>

<p>Julius carefully secreted the money in twenty different bags throughout the house. He said nothing even to his children, but remarked he had found "a little cash" and began modest buying and selling, supplementing small profits with treasure money so the family could live quietly without drawing attention.</p>

<p>Julius became an active Royalist agent. With two other trusted men, he rode out of London in Roundhead disguise, carrying nearly a thousand pounds in gold coins sewn into their clothes. At Oxford, he personally presented the money to Charles I at Christ Church college.</p>

<p>The king's response was the proudest moment of Julius's life: "Faithful Sir Julius. We count you amongst our most loyal friends." Though Julius offered to fight, the king asked him to remain in London as a reliable source of intelligence. In a deeply moving conversation, the king confided: "I cannot tell how this great matter will turn out. That is in God's hands. But if anything should befall me, Sir Julius, I have two sons – two of the blood royal to succeed me. May I ask that you will keep faith with them, as you have with me?"</p>

<p>Julius's response was immediate: "Your Majesty has no need to ask. You have my word."</p>

<p>This vow became the organizing principle of the rest of Julius's life. Through all the bleak years that followed - the execution of Archbishop Laud in 1645, Parliament's victorious campaigns, the king's imprisonment - Julius held fast to his promise.</p>

<h3 id='1649-the-kings-execution'>1649: The King's Execution</h3>

<p>On January 29th, 1649, Julius kept vigil through the cold night before the king's execution. He attended the execution itself at Whitehall, witnessing the king's dignified final moments. In the awful silence before Charles I knelt to the block, the king's eyes found Julius in the crowd. Julius made a quick bow of his head - an unmistakable signal that said: "I have promised." The king seemed to show gratitude in reply. As the axe fell, Julius murmured: "The king is dead. Long live the king."</p>

<p>Two days later, Julius received an unexpected visit from <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a> (now Jane Wheeler). She presented a document proving that Orlando Barnikel had left her his treasure chest in Sir Jacob's safe keeping. The document was authentic and accurately described the chest.</p>

<p>Julius faced a terrible dilemma. The treasure had saved his family from ruin and enabled his Royalist activities. To surrender it now, after paying the ruinous fine, would destroy everything. In a profound betrayal of his principles about keeping one's word and honoring trust, Julius lied: "I fear, Mistress Wheeler, that this document may be a forgery. I will look through my father's records. If I can find this chest, of course it will be yours. But I must tell you, I have never seen it."</p>

<p>Jane correctly identified his lie: "You're lying."</p>

<p>Outraged, Julius ordered her to leave, declaring: "No one has ever said such a thing to me." That night, he broke up the old chest, burned it in the fireplace, buried the metal remains, and hoped to put the business behind him. But Jane returned repeatedly, and Julius continued to lie and evade her rightful claims for the next sixteen years.</p>

<h3 id='1650s-the-commonwealth'>1650s: The Commonwealth</h3>

<p>During Cromwell's rule, Julius quietly maintained his Royalist principles while outwardly complying with Commonwealth regulations. On Christmas Day 1652, Julius and his family committed the "crime" of having Christmas dinner - now illegal under Puritan rules. <a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1606.html">Gideon Carpenter</a> and troops burst in during their meal and arrested the family for "profaning the Holy Day."</p>

<p>Jane Wheeler continued her harassment, loudly calling "What have you done with my money?" whenever she saw Julius in the street. Her lawyers wrote letters, but Julius politely ignored them all.</p>

<h3 id='1665-the-great-plague'>1665: The Great Plague</h3>

<p>Now aged sixty-three, Julius had weathered the Commonwealth years. When the Great Plague struck London in August 1665, Julius arranged to take his family to safety at Bocton. Before departing, he made three attempts to persuade young <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a> to come with them, but the clergyman insisted his duty was in London.</p>

<p>As Julius's carriage prepared to leave, he performed what he considered "one small service" for his young friend: he shot Meredith's dog Ned, believing dogs carried contagion. Julius tied the dog's body to the back of the cart and threw it in the river at London Bridge. "It was the least I could do to save that brave young man," Julius said, convinced of the rightness of his action.</p>

<p>During the plague, Jane Wheeler died and in her will cursed Julius: "to Sir Julius Ducket, thief and liar, who has stolen my rightful fortune and caused my ruin, I bequeath my curse. May God, who is just, send him to hellfire for his sins, and may his family be cursed hereafter and his inheritance stolen as mine has been." Meredith witnessed the will but decided not to tell Julius about the curse.</p>

<h3 id='1660-1666-the-restoration'>1660-1666: The Restoration</h3>

<p>With Charles II's restoration, Julius's loyalty was richly rewarded. The king gave him a generous state pension for life, apologizing that Parliament wouldn't allow him to purchase Bocton back for Julius. But freed from Roundhead scrutiny, Julius was able to spend the remains of the treasure and trade vigorously. Within a year he bought back Bocton at a modest price and restored the neglected estate to order.</p>

<p>Julius found the new king delightful - so different from his reserved father. Charles II was informal, humorous, and openly enjoyed life. The king remarked to Julius: "Parliament and I need each other," showing none of his father's illusions about Divine Right.</p>

<h3 id='1666-the-great-fire'>1666: The Great Fire</h3>

<p>On the night of September 1st, 1666, Julius awoke twice to look out from his house behind St Mary-le-Bow. He saw the fire beginning down Pudding Lane but encountered the mayor, who grumbled: "A woman could piss it out." Both men failed to notice the wind was rising.</p>

<p>By Sunday morning, the conflagration had grown massive. Julius spent hours watching from Cornhill as hundreds of houses burned. He encountered <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a>, who explained the crisis: "The king has ordered them to make firebreaks, but because the city authorities are afraid the owners may demand compensation, they're leaving the houses untouched!"</p>

<p>Julius witnessed the Duke of York directing operations to blow up houses with gunpowder to create firebreaks. The duke asked if Julius would help, and soon Julius found himself wearing a leather helmet and wielding a fire-axe, working alongside the duke and others to pull down walls and timbers. To his joy, he realized one of his fellow workers was the king himself.</p>

<p>"Should Your Majesty be doing this?" Julius asked.</p>

<p>"Preserving my kingdom, Sir Julius!" Charles II grinned. "You know how I try to hang on to it."</p>

<p>The fire eventually consumed Julius's house and much of the city. But Julius's loyalty and service during these crises - the plague and fire - further cemented his reputation as a faithful supporter of the crown.</p>

<h3 id='1675-the-curse-revealed'>1675: The Curse Revealed</h3>

<p>Julius learned from <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a> about Jane Wheeler's curse. Now in his seventies, Julius became deeply terrified, asking if there were prayers to say or whether they should dig up Jane's body and burn her as a witch. Meredith, a man of science and member of the Royal Society, was dismayed that his educated friend still believed in such superstition. He patiently explained: "She wasn't a witch. And anyway, you can't dig her out of a plague pit. The curse died with her."</p>

<p>Though Meredith promised to pray for him, Julius remained unconvinced and fearful.</p>

<h3 id='1679-the-earldom'>1679: The Earldom</h3>

<p>The greatest honor of Julius's life came on a July day in 1679, when at age seventy-six he was summoned to court. The political situation was tense: the question of succession had become critical. Charles II still had no legitimate heir, meaning his Catholic brother James would succeed. The Whigs were pushing an Exclusion Bill to prevent this. Charles needed loyal supporters in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>Julius, dressed in fashionable new clothes and a large grey wig, walked in St James's Park with King Charles II, who was taking the air with Nell Gwynne and others. The king informed him he would be made a baron: Lord Bocton. Julius was delighted at this ancient title for his family seat.</p>

<p>But then the king suddenly announced: "I think we can do better for Lord Bocton here. The barony of Bocton is yours, my dear lord, but how would you like to be an earl as well, eh?"</p>

<p>Julius was astonished speechless. An earldom elevated him to the upper aristocracy, with nothing above save the monarch. When Nell Gwynne impatiently urged him to choose a name, Julius seized on their location: "Could I be Earl of St James?"</p>

<p>"You can and you shall," Charles declared. "Ladies, show respect for a loyal friend. We have not so many of them. You are Earl of St James, sir, and Baron Bocton, and I count on you."</p>

<p>As Julius rode home in his carriage, he reflected that an earldom was "more desirable even than the promise of heaven." This elevation also meant significant financial benefits - Julius obtained a grant to build streets of houses on the old hunting grounds above Leicester Square (still known as "Soho"), reaping huge profits from the development of the fashionable West End.</p>

<p>Julius believed the earldom proved that Jane Wheeler's curse had failed. His family had never been more prosperous or honored.</p>

<h3 id='1685-the-secret-treaty'>1685: The Secret Treaty</h3>

<p>Everything changed for Julius in 1685 when <a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful Carpenter</a> confronted him on Pall Mall, screaming accusations about a "Royalist papist plot" and priests in the palace. The craftsman, in a state of religious mania, threatened to inform the mayor and all London, saying they would "string you and the king and all the priests up together."</p>

<p>Julius, now eighty-two, reacted swiftly. He arranged through <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a> to have Carpenter confined in the crypt of St Bride's while he worked out what to do. The crisis forced Meredith to reveal a terrible truth: Charles II had signed a secret treaty with Catholic France. The king had been in Louis XIV's pay, agreeing to help make England Catholic in exchange for French gold.</p>

<p>Julius was devastated. This revelation struck at everything he believed in - his lifelong loyalty to the Protestant cause, his vow to support the Stuart kings, his own integrity and principles. The man he had served with such devotion had betrayed England to the Catholic enemy. It was the greatest crisis of conscience in Julius's long life.</p>

<p>After agonized deliberation, Julius concluded the secret should remain buried. "It can do no good to stir that up," he told Meredith, especially after James II and his Catholic heirs were removed in the Glorious Revolution. From this point forward, Julius began voting with the Whigs, announcing he now believed kings should be subject to Parliament - a complete reversal of his lifelong Royalist absolutism, though he never explained why.</p>

<h3 id='1688-1694-final-years'>1688-1694: Final Years</h3>

<p>Julius supported the Glorious Revolution that replaced James II with the Protestant William and Mary. He lived through the establishment of the new constitutional settlement where the monarch was clearly subject to Parliament's will.</p>

<p>In 1693, Julius passed his ninetieth year. Though he walked with great difficulty, his mind remained keen. He was never lonely, as a stream of visitors came to talk to the man who had been born on the last day Queen Elizabeth I was queen. "He's seen it all," people said - from the Gunpowder Plot to the Glorious Revolution, spanning nearly the entire seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In 1694, the last year of his life, Julius witnessed the founding of the Bank of England. He took great pleasure in recalling: "I told the first King Charles it could be done. But he wouldn't listen. Perhaps it was just as well." He was particularly delighted that the new bank took offices in the rebuilt Mercers' Hall in Cheapside - his family's livery company.</p>

<p>Two months after the Bank of England's founding, Julius died one peaceful dawn in 1694, at age ninety-one.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='jacob-ducketjacob-ducket-1570html-father'><a href="characters/Jacob-Ducket-1570.html">Jacob Ducket</a> (Father)</h3>

<p>Julius adored and revered his father, carefully absorbing Sir Jacob's three fundamental lessons about order, Protestant vigilance against popery, and keeping one's word sacred. The relationship was formative, with Sir Jacob deliberately training young Julius in business and civic responsibility through regular walks to the Royal Exchange and Mercers' Hall. When Sir Jacob suffered a stroke in 1620, Julius's life plans changed entirely - he gave up Oxford to help manage the family business. Throughout his life, Julius tried to embody his father's principles, though he ultimately betrayed them when he lied about Black Barnikel's treasure.</p>

<h3 id='henry-duckethenry-ducket-1600html-elder-brother'><a href="characters/Henry-Ducket-1600.html">Henry Ducket</a> (Elder Brother)</h3>

<p>Julius regarded Henry with pride and admiration, seeing him as the epitome of aristocratic style and business genius. Where Julius had a head for figures and managed accounting, Henry possessed the social grace and connections that brought in lucrative contracts. Julius was awed by Henry's sophistication and thrilled to work alongside him. Henry's sudden death in 1638, which thrust Julius into the baronetcy and immediate arrest, marked a major turning point in Julius's life.</p>

<h3 id='charles-i'>Charles I</h3>

<p>Julius's relationship with Charles I defined much of his adult life. After personally delivering money to the king at Oxford during the Civil War, Julius received the king's confidence and a solemn request to keep faith with his sons if anything should befall him. Julius's vow became his life's organizing principle. He witnessed the king's execution and received what he interpreted as a look of gratitude when he silently promised to honor his oath. This relationship exemplified Julius's capacity for absolute loyalty and devotion to principle.</p>

<h3 id='charles-ii'>Charles II</h3>

<p>Julius served Charles II with the same devotion he had shown the father, receiving generous rewards including a pension, his house's recovery, and ultimately an earldom. Julius found the son more enjoyable - informal, humorous, and practical about politics. They worked side-by-side fighting the Great Fire. However, the discovery late in life that Charles had signed a secret treaty with Catholic France shattered Julius's faith. This betrayal by a king he had served with such devotion forced Julius to fundamentally reconsider his political principles, though he chose to keep the secret to avoid further harm to the nation.</p>

<h3 id='jane-flemingjane-fleming-1583html-jane-wheeler'><a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a> / Jane Wheeler</h3>

<p>Jane represented Julius's greatest moral failure. When she presented legitimate documentation proving her claim to Black Barnikel's treasure, Julius lied, denied all knowledge, destroyed the evidence, and maintained the deception for sixteen years. This betrayed his fundamental principle that one's word must be sacred. Jane's dying curse - calling him "thief and liar" - haunted Julius in his later years, and he feared her words might have power. The relationship exposed the gap between Julius's professed principles and his actions when self-interest was at stake.</p>

<h3 id='richard-meredithrichard-meredith-1640html'><a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Julius developed a warm friendship with Edmund's son Richard, particularly after both men were members of the Royal Society and shared intellectual interests. Julius tried repeatedly to save Meredith from the plague, even shooting his dog (which Meredith later resented). Meredith served as Julius's confidant in old age, learning about the secret treaty with France and helping Julius navigate the crisis with O Be Joyful Carpenter. Their friendship bridged the generations and represented Julius's evolution from rigid principles to more nuanced understanding.</p>

<h3 id='gideon-carpentergideon-carpenter-1606html'><a href="characters/Gideon-Carpenter-1606.html">Gideon Carpenter</a></h3>

<p>Gideon represented the Puritan opposition to Julius's Royalist principles. Their conflict was both political and personal - Gideon arrested Julius in 1638, held him during the Civil War, demanded the ruinous fine, confiscated Bocton, and raided his Christmas dinner in 1652. Yet there was a certain respect in their enmity. Both were men of principle, though on opposite sides. After the Restoration, their positions reversed, but Julius seems not to have sought revenge.</p>

<h3 id='o-be-joyful-carpentero-be-joyful-carpenter-1636html'><a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful Carpenter</a></h3>

<p>The confrontation with O Be Joyful in 1685 precipitated Julius's final crisis of conscience. The old craftsman's accusations about Catholic plots, though arising from religious mania, forced Julius to confront the truth about Charles II's betrayal. Julius's decision to temporarily confine O Be Joyful showed his continued capacity for decisive action in his eighties, but the incident ultimately led to Julius's political transformation.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Julius Ducket's extraordinarily long life (1603-1694) spanned nearly the entire seventeenth century, one of the most tumultuous periods in English history. Born the day Elizabeth I died, he witnessed the transition from Tudor to Stuart monarchy and lived through:</p>

<p><strong>The Early Stuart Period</strong>: Julius grew up during James I's reign, when tensions between Crown and Parliament, Protestant and Catholic, were building. The Gunpowder Plot of 1605, which occurred when Julius was a toddler, shaped his fierce anti-Catholic sentiment.</p>

<p><strong>The English Civil War (1642-1651)</strong>: The conflict between Royalist and Parliamentary forces divided England. Julius experienced this personally - arrested, fined twenty thousand pounds, and temporarily ruined. His secret journey to Oxford to fund Charles I's war effort represented the dangerous choices Royalists faced. The war resolved the fundamental question of whether England would be an absolute or constitutional monarchy.</p>

<p><strong>The Commonwealth and Protectorate (1649-1660)</strong>: Under Cromwell's Puritan rule, traditional religious practices were suppressed. Julius's Christmas dinner "crime" in 1652 exemplified the social controls imposed. For committed Royalists like Julius, these were years of quiet resistance and waiting.</p>

<p><strong>The Restoration (1660-1685)</strong>: Charles II's return brought Julius rewards and renewed prosperity. The period was marked by religious tolerance (within limits), colonial expansion (Julius noted the capture of New Amsterdam/New York), and cultural flowering. However, anxieties about Catholic influence remained constant.</p>

<p><strong>The Great Plague (1665)</strong>: The last major outbreak of bubonic plague killed perhaps 100,000 Londoners - about a quarter of the population. Julius's family escaped to the country, representing the flight of those wealthy enough to leave.</p>

<p><strong>The Great Fire of London (1666)</strong>: The fire destroyed 13,000 houses and 87 churches, including Julius's home. It led to London's rebuilding with wider streets, brick construction, and eventually Christopher Wren's new St Paul's Cathedral. Julius participated in fighting the fire alongside the king himself.</p>

<p><strong>The Exclusion Crisis (1679-1681)</strong>: The political battle over whether to exclude the Catholic James from succession divided Parliament and nation. Julius's earldom was a reward for supporting the Stuart succession in the House of Lords. The terms "Whig" and "Tory" emerged from this crisis.</p>

<p><strong>The Glorious Revolution (1688)</strong>: The peaceful replacement of James II with William and Mary established Parliamentary supremacy definitively. Julius's support for this represented his evolved view that kings must be subject to Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>Economic and Scientific Development</strong>: Julius witnessed the emergence of joint-stock companies, the growth of colonial trade, the founding of the Royal Society (1660), and the establishment of the Bank of England (1694). As a merchant and member of the Royal Society circle, he participated in the commercial and intellectual revolution transforming England into a global power.</p>

<p>Julius embodied the prosperous London merchant class - deeply Protestant, engaged in overseas trade, committed to order and property, and navigating the shifting political landscape while building family fortune and status.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p><strong>Loyalty and Oath-Keeping</strong>: Julius's life explored the nature of absolute loyalty. His vow to Charles I organized his entire adult life, maintained through imprisonment, financial ruin, and political defeat. Yet this same man broke faith with Jane Wheeler and destroyed evidence of her legitimate claim. The tension between Julius's professed principles and his actions when self-interest intervened reveals the complexity of moral commitment.</p>

<p><strong>The Evolution of Political Principles</strong>: Julius's transformation from absolutist Royalist to supporter of Parliamentary supremacy demonstrated how experience could reshape even the most fixed beliefs. The betrayal by Charles II - who secretly sold England to Catholic France - forced Julius to recognize that personal loyalty to monarchs must be subordinate to the national interest. His final position, that "kings should be subject to Parliament," represented the hard-won settlement of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><strong>The Merchant Class and Social Mobility</strong>: Julius's life traced the rise of London's merchant aristocracy. Born to a wealthy merchant family, he ended as an earl - a remarkable elevation showing how commerce, loyalty, and royal favor could create new nobilities. His involvement in colonial ventures, urban development, and international trade illustrated how merchant wealth was transforming English society.</p>

<p><strong>Religious Identity and Anti-Catholicism</strong>: Julius's fierce Protestantism, instilled in childhood, remained constant even as his political views evolved. His entire worldview was organized around Protestant/Catholic opposition. The secret treaty revealing Charles II's Catholic dealings devastated Julius precisely because it betrayed this fundamental religious identity. His story showed how religious sentiment shaped seventeenth-century English politics.</p>

<p><strong>Conscience and Pragmatism</strong>: Julius's decisions about Black Barnikel's treasure, shooting Meredith's dog, and concealing Charles II's treachery all involved conflicts between principle and practical judgment. He could justify each decision (the treasure saved his family; the dog carried plague; the secret would harm the nation) but lived with the consequences, including Jane's curse haunting his old age. His character explored how good people rationalize moral compromises.</p>

<p><strong>Continuity Through Catastrophe</strong>: Living from 1603 to 1694, Julius personally connected the Elizabethan age to the beginnings of modern Britain. He survived plague, fire, civil war, and revolution - catastrophes that destroyed others. His survival and success represented both luck and adaptability, but also the resilience of London's commercial elite, who rebuilt and prospered regardless of political upheavals.</p>

<p><strong>The Weight of History</strong>: Julius's old age brought a stream of visitors wanting to meet the man "who had seen it all" - from the Gunpowder Plot to the Glorious Revolution. His life became a living bridge to the past, giving him unique perspective on the century's changes. His final years suggested wisdom born of experience, including recognition that he had been wrong about royal absolutism.</p>
