<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Julius is a young Roman citizen living in third-century Londinium, working as a stevedore in the port while boxing for extra money. Born in 231, he is twenty years old during the events of the chapter, set in June 251. A cheerful optimist with distinctive features—a patch of white hair and webbed fingers—Julius becomes entangled in forgery, theft, illicit love, and witnesses a major gold heist. Despite numerous brushes with disaster, his natural resilience and good fortune eventually see him prosper, taking over the mariner's business, marrying his widow Martina, and becoming a member of the prestigious Temple of Mithras.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Julius is just under medium height with slightly short legs for his body, but very strong and wiry. His torso is hardened by training and dock work. He has striking features: blue eyes, black curls with a distinctive patch of white hair at the front (inherited from his father), and a nose that starts aquiline but becomes flattened below the bridge (not from boxing—it simply "grew that way"). His most unusual trait is webbing between his fingers, earning him the affectionate nickname "Duck" at the docks. At twenty, he has a fresh, innocent quality that suggests a young mariner just on shore, and women find him attractive. He wears the simple knee-length white wool tunic typical of working people, fastened at the shoulders and belted at the waist, with leather sandals.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Julius embodies youthful optimism and resilience. His defining characteristic is an incurable optimism—no matter how dire his circumstances, he always believes "it'll all work out." This optimism is matched by physical resilience: in boxing, he "just keeps getting up" no matter how many times he's knocked down. His blue eyes look "so eagerly upon the world" with a merry, life-filled quality that attracts women.</p>

<p>However, Julius's sunny disposition has a shadow side. He's impulsive and fails to calculate risks carefully, throwing himself into dangerous situations—forgery, theft from the governor's palace, pursuing his business partner's romantic interest—without fully considering consequences. His good nature makes him blind to meanness in others; he doesn't hold grudges and therefore fails to recognize when others might resent him. When the authorities raid the forgery operation, he experiences true panic for the first time, discovering to his surprise that panic doesn't mean frenzied movement but rather complete paralysis.</p>

<p>Julius is driven by a need for money and the pleasures it can buy. He's intensely physical—proud of his body, his boxing prowess, his strength—and equally driven by sexual desire. His infatuation with Martina consumes him, overriding both common sense and loyalty to his business partner Sextus. Yet despite these flaws, Julius is not fundamentally dishonest or cruel. He dislikes stealing but does it when desperate, and he maintains affection for his cheerful father even while keeping dangerous secrets from him.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-family-231-250'>Early Life and Family (231-250)</h3>

<p>Julius was born in 231 to Rufus, a former legionary and proud Roman citizen, and his mother, a woman of Celtic descent whose family traced back to Queen Boudicca's revolt. His father is gregarious and cheerful; his mother quiet, phlegmatic, and perpetually pessimistic, constantly warning that "those Romans are all the same. They get you in the end." He has a sister who from age nine became extremely fat, retreating from active life into passive eating. Julius finds her mysterious and has little to say to her, though she's amenable enough to help with tasks like keeping watch.</p>

<p>Growing up, Julius's father hoped he would become a legionary, but the young man showed no interest. Instead, he gravitated toward the docks, where he works unloading boats and has made a name as a promising boxer. He has "never been beaten yet by anyone my size," and spectators admire his tenacity. His webbed hands don't hinder his boxing, and his distinctive white hair patch makes him recognizable at the port.</p>

<h3 id='summer-251-the-ides-of-june'>Summer 251: The Ides of June</h3>

<p>#### The Forgery Partnership</p>

<p>By age twenty, Julius has formed a partnership with Sextus, a carpenter in his late twenties, forging silver coins. In the inflationary Roman economy, nearly half of silver coins in circulation are counterfeit, and the desperate need for currency has created a thriving illegal trade. Julius and Sextus work together in Sextus's house, using clay moulds to cast counterfeit denarii from base metal alloys. Though Sextus taught him the technique, Julius's manual dexterity makes him far better at the actual work, dramatically improving the quality of their coins.</p>

<p>The partnership works well at first. Sextus has taken Julius out drinking and introduced him to women, acting as mentor rather than rival. They've been cautious, mostly making bronze coins with only occasional silver. But with the upcoming games at the amphitheatre and the accompanying gambling and betting, they decide to make a large batch of silver coins. Julius's share will be enough "to set him up in a small business of some kind."</p>

<p>#### The Raid and Escape</p>

<p>On the ides of June, while the two men work in Sextus's house with Julius's fat sister keeping watch outside, soldiers raid them. Julius has unwittingly provoked this disaster: a boxer he defeated had noticed a suspicious silver coin in Julius's purse and sent an anonymous tip to the authorities. When the soldiers burst in, Julius experiences panic for the first time, freezing completely. Sextus acts with remarkable speed, sweeping all evidence into a bag and pushing the stunned Julius out the back. Julius escapes over walls and through alleyways, but makes a critical error: he looks back at the pursuing centurion—a big man with a scarred face—allowing the centurion to see his distinctive white-haired head.</p>

<p>Julius hides the bag of coins and moulds in a rubbish heap near a pottery kiln by the temple of Diana, then returns home, trying to act normal. That evening, his father Rufus takes him to the Temple of Mithras to meet potential business partners—two men who might stake him in a river trading business. At the temple, Julius is horrified to discover the two men are the scarred centurion who chased him that afternoon, and the mariner—husband of Martina, the woman Julius has been pursuing. Miraculously, the centurion doesn't recognize him in the temple's soft light. Both men approve of Julius for the business venture.</p>

<p>Later that night, Julius discovers his mother has found and disposed of the bag of forged coins, throwing it into the defensive ditch outside the northern wall. Despite searching at dawn, he cannot recover it.</p>

<p>#### The Pursuit of Martina</p>

<p>For two months, Julius has been increasingly infatuated with Martina, the young wife of a fifty-year-old master mariner. She is unusual in appearance—pale skin, tight-curled yellow hair indicating African ancestry, smoky blue almond-shaped eyes, and a rhythmically graceful walk. Sextus has been pursuing her, but Martina has been flirting with Julius instead, squeezing his hand, brushing against him, remarking that "every girl likes to get a present."</p>

<p>Julius's infatuation deepens until he thinks of little else. Despite knowing it's dangerous—Sextus has warned him "the girl's mine, keep your hands off her"—Julius sends Martina a letter proposing they meet at the bridge at noon during the games, promising her a present. He doesn't tell his parents about her, though his father intuits "some woman's leading you a dance."</p>

<p>#### The Day of the Games</p>

<p>The morning after the raid finds Julius broke and desperate. Without the forged coins, he has no present for Martina. Worse, Sextus confronts him about the missing money. Not believing Julius's story that his mother disposed of it, Sextus shows him a knife and says coldly: "Find the money by sundown, or I'll kill you."</p>

<p>Determined not to disappoint Martina, Julius decides to steal a present. While the city empties for the games at the amphitheatre, he wanders looking for opportunities. Most prove too difficult until he has an audacious idea: rob the Governor's Palace itself. He reasons that as a public building, he might have an excuse for being there, and everyone will be at the games. Timing the sentry's patrol precisely, he slips inside and steals a simple gold bracelet from a bedroom, deliberately leaving behind a far more valuable emerald necklace because "it seemed a pity to destroy such beautiful workmanship."</p>

<p>#### The Gold Heist</p>

<p>On his way to meet Martina at the bridge at noon, Julius witnesses something extraordinary: the scarred centurion and two soldiers moving a covered cart through the deserted streets. When a gold coin falls from the cart and the centurion looks around guiltily, Julius realizes they're stealing imperial gold from the official warehouse. He debates with himself—Martina is coming down the street toward him—but decides "the girl will wait, the gold won't" and follows the soldiers instead.</p>

<p>He tracks them through alleyways to the western hill near the temple of Diana. When he finds the cart temporarily unattended, he reaches in and pulls out a sack of gold coins—"even this was a fortune." But the soldiers catch him in the act. Julius drops the sack and runs for his life, eventually taking refuge in the amphitheatre where he hides in the crowd all afternoon, watching gladiators and beasts while scanning for his pursuers.</p>

<p>#### The Aftermath</p>

<p>Martina waits at the bridge for an hour, growing furious at being stood up. She encounters Sextus, kisses him to spite the absent Julius, and agrees to meet him that night. The mariner, who has been secretly watching his wife after becoming suspicious, observes this and assumes Sextus (whose name starts with S, like the J in Julius's letter) is his wife's lover. He kills Sextus that evening and disposes of the body in the river.</p>

<p>Julius, meanwhile, returns at dusk to search for the hidden gold near where the cart stood, unaware that Sextus is following him—and that the mariner is in turn following Sextus. Sextus is killed before he can confront Julius about the money.</p>

<h3 id='after-251-success-and-prosperity'>After 251: Success and Prosperity</h3>

<p>The mysterious disappearance of Sextus ends the forgery matter. Julius's business with the mariner prospers. The following spring, he begins an affair with Martina. The mariner, satisfied that he killed his wife's lover, never suspects Julius. When the mariner is lost at sea about a year later (c. 252-253), Julius takes over his business and marries his widow.</p>

<p>Julius rises in prosperity and respectability, becoming a successful merchant. On the birth of his second son, he achieves a long-held ambition: full membership in the exclusive Temple of Mithras lodge, "to the great delight of his father."</p>

<p>Yet one obsession haunts Julius for years. He returns repeatedly to the area where he saw the soldiers' cart, searching "by day and night" for the cache of stolen gold. The centurion's sudden transfer to Wales convinces Julius the treasure must still be hidden somewhere nearby. "Months went by, years, and still he searched." In the end, he never finds it, standing on summer evenings "by the quay or on the ramparts of the great wall of Londinium, watching the departing sun," wondering: "Where, by all the gods, was that gold?"</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='rufus-father'>Rufus (Father)</h3>

<p>Julius's relationship with his father is affectionate but somewhat distant. Rufus is a cheerful, red-faced man, gregarious and proud—proud of being a Roman citizen, and especially of his membership in the Temple of Mithras lodge. He loves his son and wants to help him succeed, arranging the fateful meeting with the centurion and the mariner. Rufus is perceptive enough to sense that some woman is "leading [Julius] a dance," but Julius never confides in him about Martina or his criminal activities. On the night of the temple visit, Rufus is "beaming" with paternal pride, feeling "that he had done a good job." The relationship reflects Julius's broader pattern: keeping his riskier activities secret while maintaining warm surface relations.</p>

<h3 id='mother'>Mother</h3>

<p>Julius's mother is Celtic by descent, still connected to pre-Roman Britain through family memory. She is quiet, humourless, pale-faced "like pastry before it is cooked," and perpetually pessimistic. She carries "the burden of some glum memory" and constantly warns about Roman treachery. Despite this dour personality, she loves her children. When she discovers the forged coins, she acts swiftly to protect Julius, disposing of the evidence without hesitation. Julius seems to feel affection for her but also finds her oppressive, dreading the confrontation about the coins.</p>

<h3 id='sextus'>Sextus</h3>

<p>Sextus is Julius's partner in crime and mentor in adult pleasures. A swarthy carpenter with thinning dark hair, thick muttonchop sideburns, and deep-set eyes, Sextus initially acts as the older, wiser friend, taking Julius drinking and introducing him to women. But when Julius pursues Martina, their relationship sours. Sextus's warning—"The girl's mine. Keep your hands off her"—marks a turning point. After the raid and the loss of the forged coins, Sextus completely distrusts Julius, convinced he either stole the money or betrayed him to authorities. His threat to kill Julius is sincere. The relationship shows Julius's weakness: his inability to see that his actions might provoke resentment, and his tendency to jeopardize important partnerships for immediate pleasures.</p>

<h3 id='martina'>Martina</h3>

<p>Julius's relationship with Martina begins with infatuation and becomes reality. He first notices her distinctive appearance—African ancestry, unusual hair, smoky eyes, rhythmic walk—and becomes increasingly obsessed. "Her smoky eyes seemed to hover in the rigging" as he works. His infatuation has an almost fetishistic quality: "Her feet had seemed a little large to him at first, but now he found them sensual." The affair begins in spring 252, while the mariner is still alive but believes he has dealt with the threat. When Julius marries her after the mariner's death, it represents both romantic fulfillment and social advancement—taking over a successful business along with the widow. The relationship suggests Julius's combination of romantic idealism and practical opportunism.</p>

<h3 id='the-centurion'>The Centurion</h3>

<p>The centurion is a complex figure in Julius's life—pursuer, benefactor, and unwitting rival. A big, grizzled man with a scar running down his cheek, he leads the raid on Sextus's house and nearly catches Julius. Yet that evening at the temple, dressed as the Raven in the Mithraic ceremony, he doesn't recognize the young man he chased. Julius senses something hidden about him: "behind those hard eyes lay something else, something hidden... The bluff soldier was a man of secrets." Julius is proven right when he witnesses the centurion's theft. The centurion's sudden transfer to Wales after the theft is discovered saves Julius from further investigation but also ensures the stolen gold remains hidden forever.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Julius lives during a critical period in Roman history. The year 251 falls in the Crisis of the Third Century (235-284), when the empire experienced political instability, economic collapse, and constant military threats. The chapter notes that "no fewer than five emperors had been proclaimed" that year alone, yet Britain remains "a haven of peace and modest prosperity."</p>

<p>The rampant inflation and currency debasement that drives Julius's forgery operation was a real phenomenon. Imperial mints, desperate to produce enough coins, reduced silver content in denarii to as low as 4 per cent, making counterfeiting both easier and more tempting. The text notes that "nearly half the silver coins in circulation at this date were probably counterfeit." Julius and Sextus are participating in an empire-wide informal economy of private coin production.</p>

<p>Londinium itself, about 208 years old by 251, is presented at its height. With perhaps 25,000 inhabitants, a massive basilica ("the biggest in northern Europe"), a fine amphitheatre, temples, baths, and a sophisticated road network, it represents Roman civilization at its peak in Britain. Yet this prosperity is fragile. The need for naval forts against Germanic pirates (mentioned in the chapter) foreshadows future Saxon raids that will eventually overwhelm Roman Britain.</p>

<p>Julius's father's pride in Roman citizenship reflects social realities. Originally restricted to Italians and specially honored provincials, citizenship was extended to nearly all freemen in the empire by Emperor Caracalla in 212. Rufus's insistence that his family "were citizens before that" shows how status anxiety persisted even after the honor became commonplace.</p>

<p>The Temple of Mithras represents a religious world in flux. This Persian mystery cult, popular with soldiers and merchants, competed with Christianity for adherents. Both religions had similar features—initiation rites, moral codes, emphasis on life after death, celebration of their god's birthday on December 25. The exclusivity of the Mithraic lodge (only 60-70 could fit in Londinium's temple) contrasts with Christianity's growing appeal to slaves and the poor. Within two centuries, Christianity would triumph and temples like this would be abandoned or destroyed.</p>

<p>Julius lives at a moment when Roman order still holds but the forces that will destroy it are gathering. His story of forgery, theft, and casual violence amidst apparent prosperity captures an empire maintaining appearances while its foundations crack.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Julius embodies resilience and adaptability in uncertain times. His defining characteristic—the inability to stay down when knocked out—serves as a metaphor for survival in the unstable third century. No matter what disasters befall him (raids, threats, lost opportunities), Julius bounces back, always optimistic that things will work out. And remarkably, for Julius, they do.</p>

<p>His story illustrates the gap between appearance and reality in Roman society. Londinium appears orderly and prosperous, but beneath the surface lies endemic crime: forgery is so widespread that half the silver coins are fake, and even the authorities charged with stopping it are themselves thieves, stealing imperial gold. Julius navigates this world successfully by maintaining respectable appearances (proud citizen's son, promising boxer, eventually temple member) while participating in its underground economy.</p>

<p>The character explores the role of luck versus character in success. Julius succeeds not because of superior planning or morality—his decision-making is consistently impulsive and often disastrous—but because he's fortunate. The centurion doesn't recognize him; the mariner kills Sextus instead of him; the mariner conveniently dies at sea. Julius's optimism appears foolish throughout the story but is ultimately vindicated. Is he wise to trust in luck, or simply lucky that his trust proves justified?</p>

<p>His pursuit of Martina at the expense of the gold becomes the story's central irony. In the moment of decision, Julius chooses what he thinks is practical—follow the gold, it won't wait—over the romantic option. But he loses the gold anyway and eventually gets the girl. His search for the gold continues for years, an obsession that haunts his otherwise successful life. The hidden treasure represents the fantasy of easy wealth that can never quite be relinquished, even by someone who has achieved genuine prosperity through normal means.</p>

<p>Julius also represents the cultural mixing that characterized Roman Britain. His mother is Celtic, his father has Italian blood, he lives in a cosmopolitan port where people come from across the empire, and he marries a woman of Numidian ancestry. His family has been in Britain for generations yet identifies strongly as Roman. He embodies the successful fusion of Celtic and Roman identities in the province—a fusion that will not survive the coming centuries.</p>

<p>Finally, Julius's story touches on the theme of casual moral compromise. He doesn't see himself as a criminal, yet he forges coins, steals from the governor, commits adultery with a married woman, and threatens his sister with a knife. These actions seem to him merely practical responses to circumstances, not fundamental betrayals of morality. His eventual respectability and temple membership suggest the Roman world's pragmatic approach to morality: what matters is success, status, and maintaining appearances, not the means by which they were achieved. Julius becomes a respected merchant and family man despite a past that, if known, would have seen him executed. The story suggests that in a world of systemic corruption, personal morality becomes whatever allows one to survive and prosper.</p>
