<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Gilbert Bull is a prosperous London mercer and country gentleman who represents the social mobility of medieval England, where younger sons of gentry families could honorably return to trade. Living in a grand house on London Bridge, he is a sound and agreeable businessman who serves in Parliament and carefully manages his fortune. Though he dreams of a male heir to carry on the Bull name, his life is marked by the dark memory of the Black Death and an excessive need to control his world—a characteristic that ultimately leads to conflict with his son-in-law <a href="characters/Geoffrey-Ducket-1361.html">Geoffrey Ducket</a> over family legacy and the Bull name itself.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Bull is described as having a burly form, with a large and impressive presence. He has a big face that can look stern or turn red when angry, and blue eyes that can glower when in a rage. Though stocky in build, he is not particularly agile—as shown when he was splattered with mud from a passing cart while the nimble young <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a> leaped aside. He is still vigorous well into his sixties.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Gilbert Bull embodies the qualities his family name suggests: he is sound, steadfast, and never breaks his word. Everyone agrees he is an agreeable fellow and absolutely reliable in business dealings. He possesses intelligence and harbors private intellectual interests—he likes to read books and indulges a taste for mathematics, though these are "small weaknesses" he keeps under complete control, lest they interfere with his practical merchant's life.</p>

<p>However, Bull's character is shaped by a defining trauma: the Black Death of 1348. This "dark memory" makes him overly cautious and anxious to control everything around him. His need for order extends to his view of the universe itself—he believes in the proper hierarchical structure of society and is deeply offended when that order is disrupted, whether by the Commons impeaching the king's ministers or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_II_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard II</a> being deposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry IV</a>.</p>

<p>Bull is scrupulously fair in his dealings, but also capable of harsh judgment. When he feels betrayed, particularly regarding broken promises, his anger is formidable. His statement that someone "broke his word" represents the most terrible indictment a Bull can make. Though he can be expansive and generous when in good spirits, he is also stubborn and prideful, especially concerning the Bull family name and legacy.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1357-marriage-decision'>1357: Marriage Decision</h3>

<p>At age twenty-seven, standing on London Bridge during the triumphal procession for the captured King of France, Gilbert decides to marry. His chosen bride is the daughter of a prominent goldsmith with gentry connections—short, pleasant-looking with large dark rings around her eyes, but of cheerful temper and sound judgment. She will bring a handsome dowry and shares all his opinions about life. The marriage is destined to be very happy, though she will never bear him a surviving son.</p>

<h3 id='youth-and-background-c-1330-1357'>Youth and Background (c. 1330-1357)</h3>

<p>Born the younger son of the Bulls of Bocton, Gilbert faced the common dilemma of English primogeniture. With the estate going to his elder brother, he had limited options. At fourteen, he fought at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crécy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crécy</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Black_Prince" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Prince</a>, but the experience convinced him that a military career meant little better than brigandage without a powerful patron. Following his father's advice, he went to London and became a mercer, trading in linen and imported cloth. With money and family connections, he soon prospered.</p>

<h3 id='1348-the-black-death'>1348: The Black Death</h3>

<p>The plague's arrival in London became Gilbert's "dark memory." Following his father's orders, he fled to Bocton, where the estate was virtually sealed off for a month. By God's grace, the plague passed them by. When he returned to London, the world had changed—and a girl he had loved was gone with all her family, their burial place unknown. Though London recovered with astonishing speed, the plague would return periodically for centuries, and Bull never forgot.</p>

<h3 id='1361-the-foundling'>1361: The Foundling</h3>

<p>While standing with young Chaucer at the southern end of London Bridge, Bull encounters an abandoned baby boy, about three months old, who had been left beside the road. Despite his fear that the child might carry plague (several London parishes had suffered an outbreak), Bull is won over when the baby laughs at him after he is splattered with mud. He adopts the child, whom Chaucer discovers is named Geoffrey from a family called Ducket who died of plague. The foundling becomes part of Bull's household, though Bull makes it clear: "Your name is Ducket. Ours is Bull."</p>

<h3 id='1376-parliament-and-family-tensions'>1376: Parliament and Family Tensions</h3>

<p>Bull represents a West Country borough in the "Good Parliament" of 1376, where the Commons impeaches royal ministers and forces the dismissal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward III</a>'s mistress <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Perrers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice Perrers</a>. Though this marks a constitutional landmark, Bull finds the spectacle depressing—watching the old king being savaged by Commons men reminds him of his own mortality and offends his sense of proper order.</p>

<p>That same year, his cousin James Bull visits to propose marriage to Bull's daughter Tiffany, pointing out that this would keep the Bull fortune in the family. Bull is insulted by the young man's frank assumption that Bull is unlikely to have a son at his age. Though Bull's wife has miscarried three times since Tiffany's birth, he still secretly hopes for a male heir.</p>

<p>Bull becomes fascinated by his daughter's choice of husband, having promised her she could marry whomever she wished. Over the years, he develops an unusually close relationship with Tiffany, confiding in her and awaiting her verdict on various suitors. Among these, he particularly favors <a href="characters/Benedict-Silversleeves-1352.html">Benedict Silversleeves</a>, a clever young lawyer who impresses everyone with his knowledge of astrolabes and astronomy.</p>

<h3 id='1378-1380-business-and-family-matters'>1378-1380: Business and Family Matters</h3>

<p>When the royal princes withdraw from London to punish the city for an alleged attack on one of them, Bull contributes four pounds to the massive bribe that brings them back. During this period, Bull remains unaware that Dame Barnikel suspects young Ducket of theft from Fleming's strongbox—though when consulted, Bull can only suggest that one never knows with a foundling, given "bad blood."</p>

<h3 id='1381-the-peasants-revolt'>1381: The Peasants' Revolt</h3>

<p>Bull is at Bocton when Wat Tyler's rebellion sweeps through Kent. He returns to London to find half the peasants from around Bocton have joined Tyler's march to Canterbury. When the rebels reach London, Bull stands on the bridge and bellows at the alderman in charge to raise the drawbridge as ordered by the mayor. The alderman refuses, letting the mob through, and Bull can only rush home to bar his doors and shutters as his house is engulfed by the moving mass.</p>

<p>His cousin James Bull distinguishes himself during the revolt by attempting to stop looters at the Savoy and eventually capturing Ducket, whom James mistakenly believes was looting. Bull locks Ducket in his kitchen, disgusted by what he believes is betrayal. Only after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_II_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Richard II</a> personally pardons Ducket does Bull release him, though grudgingly.</p>

<h3 id='1390s-betrayal-and-inheritance'>1390s: Betrayal and Inheritance</h3>

<p>After his wife dies (c. 1390), Bull's relationship with his daughter and son-in-law deteriorates when he discovers they have secretly changed Ducket's surname to Bull—which they view as honoring the family but Bull sees as deception. He is particularly wounded because Ducket had promised to keep his own name. Bull's angry response is unequivocal: "He broke his word."</p>

<p>Feeling betrayed and no longer needed by Ducket's brilliant business success, Bull declares his intention to remarry and produce a legitimate heir. This throws Tiffany and Ducket into a panic, as Bull's considerable fortune would then pass to a new son rather than to Tiffany.</p>

<p>Tiffany attempts to find her father a mistress who is either past childbearing or married (and thus unavailable for marriage), even approaching Dame Barnikel. These efforts fail, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Whittington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Whittington</a> solves the problem by arranging for Bull to meet Sister Olive, the nun from St Helen's convent. Bull and Sister Olive begin an affair that lasts eight years and proves highly satisfactory—so much so that Bull's desire for the "rigours of matrimony" soon leaves him.</p>

<h3 id='1395-1405-final-years-at-bocton'>1395-1405: Final Years at Bocton</h3>

<p>When both the heir to Bocton and his grief-stricken father die in 1395, the lovely old Kent estate passes to Gilbert Bull. Now the richest member of his family who ever lived, he quits the house on London Bridge (which Tiffany and Ducket take over) and retires to his childhood home.</p>

<p>His family pride is somewhat mollified when a herald from the College of Arms explains that since Ducket has his own arms and Tiffany is an armorial heiress, the arms of Bull and Ducket can be joined, giving Bull a heraldic immortality for future generations. As he looks out from Bocton across the sweep of the Weald of Kent, his retirement years are bathed in soft and gentle light.</p>

<p>Two shadows cross this pleasant landscape. First, Richard II's deposition by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry IV</a> offends Bull's sense of propriety—the new king has usurped another's rightful place, disrupting the order of the universe. "In the long run," he warns, "it will lead to trouble."</p>

<p>The second shadow comes in 1400, when plague returns to London. Bull carries his family to safety at Bocton, waiting on the high ridge until it passes. But when they return to London in late October, they discover that Chaucer has died. Bull is grief-stricken, crying "Why didn't I think of him? Why didn't I bring him to Bocton?" When monks tell him that Chaucer repented of his impious Canterbury Tales and wanted them burned, Bull is dubious but philosophical—viewing the great work, unfinished and "so hopelessly, so mistakenly, in English," as doomed to be lost or forgotten anyway. He is somewhat comforted to find Chaucer buried in Westminster Abbey, though deflated to learn this is only because Chaucer was an Abbey tenant, not because of his literary achievements.</p>

<p>Bull dies around 1405, and Bocton passes to Tiffany. Though Ducket comes to love the estate, he always says "my home is in London," living there contentedly until his own old age.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='tiffany-bull-daughter'>Tiffany Bull (Daughter)</h3>

<p>Bull adores his only surviving child, describing her as a "pretty little thing" who almost compensates for his lack of a son. He indulges her unusually for a medieval father, promising she can marry whomever she wishes—a concession few fathers in his position would give. As Tiffany grows, Bull develops an unexpectedly close relationship with her, sharing confidences and discussing the merits of her various suitors. His pride in her judgment is evident: "Do you know what she really thinks of young so-and-so?" he says proudly to his wife.</p>

<p>This affection makes the eventual betrayal over the name change all the more painful. When he discovers they changed Ducket's name without telling him, he feels it as treachery: "It's the fortune of Bull you expect to inherit, not of Ducket." Yet despite this breach, as he sees his merry grandchildren at Bocton, he cannot fail to be taken with them, and the relationship eventually mends.</p>

<h3 id='geoffrey-ducket-son-in-law'>Geoffrey Ducket (Son-in-law)</h3>

<p>Bull's relationship with Ducket is complex and contradictory. He rescues the baby from abandonment, raises him in his household, and ensures he is treated fairly—but always makes it clear that Ducket is not truly part of the Bull family. When twelve-year-old Ducket says he wants to be a mercer like Bull and Whittington, Bull crushes the dream: "That is impossible. The Mercers Guild is for merchants, people with money.. . You've no money, you see. You must learn a craft."</p>

<p>Bull respects Ducket's cheerful spirit and eventually comes to appreciate his godfather Chaucer's protégé, but he cannot entirely overcome his prejudice. When Dame Barnikel suggests Ducket might be a thief, Bull's first instinct is "you never know with a foundling. Bad blood." During the Peasants' Revolt, he is quick to believe Ducket was looting.</p>

<p>The relationship reaches its crisis when Ducket becomes so successful in business that he adopts the Bull name. Bull sees this not as an honor but as broken faith—Ducket had promised to keep his own name. The betrayal cuts deep: "He broke his word," Bull declares, the worst judgment a Bull can make. His threat to remarry and produce a new heir is meant to punish them.</p>

<p>Yet ultimately, the relationship endures. Bull's grandchildren win him over, and the heraldic compromise—joining the arms of Bull and Ducket—gives him a measure of peace. By the end of his life, Bull has accepted that Ducket, despite not bearing the Bull name alone, will carry forward the family legacy.</p>

<h3 id='geoffrey-chaucer'>Geoffrey Chaucer</h3>

<p>Bull greatly admires Chaucer, finding him distinguished and agreeable company. It is Chaucer who persuades Bull to settle money on the foundling Ducket and arrange his apprenticeship. The two men maintain a friendship over the decades, and Bull is deeply moved when Chaucer gives him an astrolabe for his birthday. Chaucer's death in 1400 devastates Bull, who cries out in misery: "Why didn't I think of him? Why didn't I bring him to Bocton?"</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Gilbert Bull lives through one of England's most dramatic periods. He fights at Crécy (1346) as a teenager, witnessing the triumph of English longbows and chivalry. The Black Death (1348) shapes his entire worldview, making him cautious and control-seeking. He prospers during the successful French wars under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward III</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Black_Prince" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Prince</a>, when England's merchants enjoy unprecedented wealth from trade and plunder.</p>

<p>As a member of the Good Parliament (1376), Bull participates in constitutional history—the Commons establishing their Speaker and the practice of impeachment—though he finds it distasteful. He lives through the boy-king Richard II's troubled reign, the Peasants' Revolt (1381), and the usurpation by Henry IV (1399), which offends his sense of divine order.</p>

<p>Bull represents the prosperous London merchant class that dominated the city through their guilds, served in Parliament, and maintained strong connections to country estates. His house on London Bridge—then a street of grand residences and shops—places him at the literal center of London's commercial world. His transition from merchant to country gentleman, retiring to Bocton in his sixties, reflects the fluid movement between trade and gentry that characterized English society, distinguishing it from more rigid Continental social structures.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Gilbert Bull embodies several key themes in Rutherford's exploration of London's history:</p>

<p><strong>Social Mobility and Class Fluidity</strong>: Bull represents the uniquely English ability to move between classes. As a gentleman's son who becomes a merchant and then retires as a country squire, he exemplifies the social mobility that Continental Europe lacked. His cousin James Bull's successful brewery shows the family's continued ability to rise through trade, while Bull's acceptance (however reluctant) of Ducket's rise from foundling to wealthy merchant demonstrates London's capacity to absorb newcomers.</p>

<p><strong>The Power of Names and Legacy</strong>: Bull's obsession with his family name drives much of his later life conflict. His desperate desire for a male heir to carry the Bull name, his fury when Ducket adopts it, and his eventual acceptance of the heraldic compromise all illustrate how medieval people viewed names as conferring immortality. The irony that Ducket—a foundling with possibly no blood connection—becomes the true inheritor of the Bull legacy suggests that family is made through action and character rather than birth.</p>

<p><strong>Order and Disorder</strong>: Bull's need for control, born of Black Death trauma, reflects the medieval worldview that saw the universe as an ordered hierarchy from God down through the celestial spheres to earthly society. Events that disrupt this order—the Commons impeaching ministers, peasants revolting, one king deposing another—deeply disturb Bull because they threaten his sense of cosmic stability. His evolution from this rigid worldview to accepting life's unpredictability marks his character growth.</p>

<p><strong>The Making of England</strong>: Through Bull, Rutherford shows how England's distinctive institutions evolved. Bull participates in the Good Parliament's constitutional innovations, witnesses the Peasants' Revolt's social upheaval, and lives through dynastic instability—all events that shaped England's unique political development. His friendship with Chaucer connects him to the emergence of English literature and language, though Bull cannot yet see its significance.</p>

<p><strong>The Long Shadow of Plague</strong>: The Black Death is Bull's formative trauma, shaping his excessive caution and need to control his environment. His instinctive flight to Bocton whenever plague threatens, his initial reluctance to adopt baby Ducket for fear of infection, and his successful protection of his family in 1400—all show how plague haunted medieval consciousness and drove both personal and social behavior.</p>
