<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Amy Fleming is the daughter of John Fleming, a grocer, and the formidable <a href="characters/Dame-Barnikel-1346.html">Dame Barnikel</a>, owner of the George tavern in Southwark. A shy, quiet young woman who resembles her father in appearance and temperament, Amy spends much of her youth betrothed to the solemn craftsman <a href="characters/Ben-Carpenter-1362.html">Ben Carpenter</a>, though her mother disapproves of the match. The tumultuous events of the early 1380s—including the Peasants' Revolt, her father's tragic death, and her friendship with <a href="characters/Tiffany-Bull-1365.html">Tiffany Bull</a>—ultimately lead her to change her mind about whom she will marry.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Amy has her father's thin, concave face and spindly build, though she is more strongly built than him. She has a tendency toward silence and paleness. Dame Barnikel worries that she looks "as if [she'd] been kept under a pot." She is described as "not bad-looking" once she gains confidence.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Amy is quiet, shy, and reserved by nature, taking after her father rather than her forceful mother. She is dutiful and domestic, preferring to help in the house rather than take an interest in her mother's brewing business. When asked about learning a craft of her own, she quietly responds that she "just want[s] to get married."</p>

<p>Despite her shyness, Amy possesses quiet determination and loyalty. Once betrothed to Carpenter, she clings to the arrangement "with silent determination, as if the carpenter were a raft in a stormy sea." She shows courage during the Peasants' Revolt, seeking out <a href="characters/Geoffrey-Ducket-1361.html">Geoffrey Ducket</a> to help find and save Carpenter. She also demonstrates thoughtfulness and discernment in her observations of people and events.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of her father's death, Amy reveals unexpected strength and practical wisdom. She befriends Tiffany Bull and helps her understand the truth about Ducket's character, showing both loyalty to her father's wishes and good judgment about people.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1376-the-betrothal-question'>1376: The Betrothal Question</h3>

<p>At age eleven, Amy faces her mother's strong disapproval of her attachment to Ben Carpenter, a solemn young craftsman with bandy legs and a round face. Dame Barnikel considers him dull and possibly "moonstruck," urging Amy to forget about him and instead consider young Ducket, her husband's cheerful apprentice.</p>

<p>Despite her mother's objections, Amy's father likes Carpenter, and Dame Barnikel respects her husband's opinion enough not to simply dismiss the suitor. When her mother suggests the young craftsman is "not right in the head," Amy bursts into tears and flees.</p>

<p>Amy develops an easy friendship with Ducket during this period. The three of them—Amy, Carpenter, and Ducket—often walk out together to Clapham or Battersea, or go swimming in the river on summer afternoons.</p>

<h3 id='1376-1377-growing-up'>1376-1377: Growing Up</h3>

<p>Dame Barnikel attempts to push Amy and Ducket together, at one point even locking them in a storehouse together in a drunken attempt at matchmaking. In the cold store, Amy sits with Ducket in silence until he puts his arm around her for warmth. She asks him directly: "Do you think Ben Carpenter's mad?" When he reassures her that Carpenter is not mad, she seems satisfied.</p>

<p>Shortly before Christmas, Carpenter and Amy formally present their betrothal proposal to her parents. Carpenter suggests they wait three years before marrying, as Amy is only thirteen and not yet a woman, and he wishes to establish himself as a master craftsman first. To Amy's dismay, Dame Barnikel enthusiastically agrees with the long engagement, hoping Amy will "grow out of him by then."</p>

<h3 id='1380-religious-concerns'>1380: Religious Concerns</h3>

<p>By spring 1380, Amy notices that Carpenter has something troubling on his mind. He confides in her that he is worried about God and has been influenced by the teachings of John Wycliffe, the religious reformer. Carpenter warns her that "something bad is going to happen" and that "God will probably send a sign."</p>

<p>Despite his brooding, Carpenter continues to court her steadily, and Amy takes comfort in knowing she can rely on him. Whatever his religious obsessions, "their own little ship sailed on, sound and steady."</p>

<p>While Amy remains friendly with Ducket during this period, her mother grows cold and watchful toward the apprentice, though Amy does not know why (Dame Barnikel suspects Ducket of stealing money that was actually lost by Amy's father).</p>

<h3 id='1381-the-peasants-revolt'>1381: The Peasants' Revolt</h3>

<p>When the Peasants' Revolt reaches London in June 1381, Amy discovers that Carpenter has secretly joined the rebels. She is frightened for his safety and begs Ducket to help find him. "It's Ben," she cries softly to Ducket. "I can't find him. I'm so afraid he'll get himself hurt." When Ducket assumes the rebels haven't entered the city yet, she corrects him: "You don't understand. It's the other way round"—Carpenter has gone out to join them.</p>

<p>Ducket finds Carpenter at Blackheath with the rebel army and ultimately saves his life at the Savoy Palace when Carpenter is trapped in a burning building. Amy's instinct to seek Ducket's help proves correct.</p>

<h3 id='1382-tragedy-and-transformation'>1382: Tragedy and Transformation</h3>

<p>In May 1382, Amy's father commits suicide after his involvement with the fraudulent alchemist <a href="characters/Benedict-Silversleeves-1352.html">Benedict Silversleeves</a> is revealed to Ducket. John Fleming leaves a note confessing to stealing money (which he lost trying to make gold) and urging that Ducket take over the business, calling him "a good friend" who is "very loyal" and can be trusted.</p>

<p>This tragedy causes Amy to reconsider her future. The note's "ringing endorsement of Ducket" and her father's desire for him to take his place makes her wonder if her father was "trying, in his own way, to tell her something before he departed."</p>

<p>She reflects on recent events: Carpenter's dangerous involvement with the rebels at the Savoy, his possession of illegal Lollard texts, and her own father's secret troubles. She realizes that it was Ducket who saved or tried to save both men. "It was Ducket, after all, who was the strong one. Ducket the brave."</p>

<p>Dame Barnikel, having discovered she was wrong about Ducket, praises him warmly to Amy: "He's a plucky, loyal fellow. Loyal." Amy notices that Dame Barnikel is hinting she should reconsider her choice. Amy begins to think that while Carpenter has always "seemed secure," he is actually a risk, while Ducket, though "carefree," is the truly reliable one.</p>

<h3 id='meeting-with-tiffany-bull'>Meeting with Tiffany Bull</h3>

<p>Shortly after her father's death, Tiffany Bull seeks out Amy at the George, asking for help. Tiffany explains that Ducket has accused her fiancé Silversleeves of being a fraud and necromancer, but she doesn't know whether to believe him. Tiffany asks Amy what she knows of Ducket's character.</p>

<p>Amy tells Tiffany the full story: how Ducket saved Carpenter during the revolt, and how her father's death revealed that Ducket was innocent of the theft he'd been suspected of committing. When Amy explains that her father lost money but wouldn't say how, and that Ducket knows but won't tell, both girls suddenly realize: "Silversleeves," they say together.</p>

<p>Though they have no proof, Tiffany declares she won't marry Silversleeves. When Amy points out she has no proof and Silversleeves will deny everything, Tiffany suddenly laughs with relief: "Never mind. I never really liked him."</p>

<p>Amy confides to her new friend: "I'll tell you something. I'm planning to ditch my man Carpenter too, only nobody knows." When Tiffany asks if she has someone else in mind, Amy smiles broadly: "Why, Ducket, of course."</p>

<h3 id='the-wedding'>The Wedding</h3>

<p>While Amy secretly decides not to marry Carpenter, Ducket ends up saving Tiffany's life and marrying her instead, taking the Bull name. Amy's own wedding to Carpenter takes place a month later than originally planned. On the eve of the wedding, Dame Barnikel announces her own plans to marry James Bull, effectively joining the two families together through the Bull Brewery.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='john-fleming'>John Fleming</h3>

<p>Amy deeply resembles her quiet father in both appearance and temperament. She has his "thin, concave face" and "tendency to silence." Unlike her mother, Amy never took an interest in business, preferring domestic life. Her father's support of Ben Carpenter as a suitor is important to her, and after his death, his written endorsement of Ducket has a profound impact on her thinking. His suicide and his final message urging trust in Ducket ultimately help her see who is truly reliable and worthy of her trust.</p>

<h3 id='dame-barnikel'>Dame Barnikel</h3>

<p>Amy's relationship with her formidable mother is complex. Dame Barnikel, a Barnikel of Billingsgate by birth and force of personality, is puzzled by her quiet daughter who has no interest in the brewing business and simply wants to marry. The two clash over Amy's choice of Carpenter, whom Dame Barnikel considers dull and possibly mad. Dame Barnikel attempts various schemes to push Amy toward Ducket instead, including drunkenly locking them in a storehouse together.</p>

<p>Despite their differences, there is affection between them. Dame Barnikel tells Amy: "A man is what you make of him," and tries to teach her daughter how to "bring a man out." After Fleming's death, Dame Barnikel's praise of Ducket influences Amy's final decision, though Amy arrives at her conclusions independently as well.</p>

<h3 id='ben-carpenter'>Ben Carpenter</h3>

<p>Amy is betrothed to the solemn craftsman for several years, from around age eleven onward. She admires his "quiet strength" and clings to their betrothal arrangement with determination. However, she privately wonders "how she would accomplish" the task of "bringing a man out" with someone like Carpenter.</p>

<p>The Peasants' Revolt disconcerts her—Carpenter's willingness to join the rebels and his continued insistence that "we still live under a godless authority" trouble her. His obsession with Lollard texts and religious reform also concerns her. After her father's death, she realizes that Carpenter's obsessions might lead them into danger, while it was Ducket who proved truly reliable. Though she "knew she did not love Carpenter," she had previously seen him as secure. Events force her to recognize that "the solemn craftsman's obsessions" might actually be a risk.</p>

<p>Despite her change of heart, Amy does ultimately marry Carpenter as planned, about a month after Ducket's wedding to Tiffany.</p>

<h3 id='geoffrey-ducket'>Geoffrey Ducket</h3>

<p>Amy's relationship with Ducket evolves significantly over the course of several years. Initially, they have "an easy friendship," with Ducket, Carpenter, and Amy often spending time together. After Dame Barnikel locks them in the storehouse together, Amy is quietly aware of her mother's matchmaking intentions, though she remains loyal to Carpenter.</p>

<p>During the Peasants' Revolt, Amy turns to Ducket for help when she fears for Carpenter's safety, showing that she instinctively trusts him in a crisis. After her father's death and his written endorsement of Ducket, Amy begins to see him differently. She observes that while Carpenter seemed secure but turned out to be a risk, Ducket seemed carefree but proved to be "the strong one. Ducket the brave."</p>

<p>Amy decides she wants to marry Ducket and confides this to Tiffany. However, Ducket ends up saving Tiffany's life and marrying her instead, and Amy proceeds with her marriage to Carpenter as originally planned.</p>

<h3 id='tiffany-bull'>Tiffany Bull</h3>

<p>Though Amy had seen Tiffany before, they never spoke until after John Fleming's death. When Tiffany seeks Amy out for advice about Ducket's character, the two young women form a quick bond of friendship. Amy admires Tiffany's fine silk clothes and "dainty way" of sitting, finding it strange that her simple young Ducket once lived in the same house as "this creature from another world."</p>

<p>The two girls work together to puzzle out the truth about Silversleeves, and Amy frankly shares information about Ducket that helps Tiffany trust him. She finds it "curious how she should already feel a bond of friendship" with Tiffany, despite their different social positions. They share confidences about their respective betrothals, with Amy revealing her secret plan to "ditch" Carpenter.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Amy's life unfolds during one of the most turbulent periods in medieval English history. Born around 1365, she grows up in the shadow of the Black Death (which killed perhaps a third of England's population in 1348-49) and the ongoing Hundred Years' War with France.</p>

<p>The Poll Taxes of 1377-1381, designed to fund the war, create enormous social tension. In 1381, when Amy is about sixteen, the great Peasants' Revolt shakes London to its core. Rebels led by Wat Tyler march on London, burning the Savoy Palace and demanding reforms. Amy's fiancé is caught up in these events, joining the rebels in their cause. The revolt ends with Tyler's death at Smithfield and brutal reprisals against the rebels.</p>

<p>The religious debates of the era also touch Amy's life through Carpenter. John Wycliffe's challenge to Church authority, his call for an English Bible, and the emergence of the Lollards represent a crisis in religious authority. After John Ball's sermons during the revolt, possession of Lollard texts is seen as dangerous sedition by authorities. Carpenter's ownership of Wyclif's Bible places him—and by extension Amy—in potential danger.</p>

<p>Amy's marriage to a craftsman reflects the social structure of 14th-century London, where skilled craftsmen held respected positions in society. Her father's trade as a grocer and her mother's ownership of a tavern represent the rising commercial class of London. Her mother's ability to continue running the George tavern after widowhood, and then after remarriage, reflects the somewhat greater economic freedom enjoyed by women in medieval London compared to other parts of Europe, though this was largely limited to widows continuing family businesses.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Amy represents the quiet strength that can hide beneath a shy exterior. While she appears passive and easily overlooked—particularly next to her forceful mother—she possesses her own form of determination and eventually makes her own choices about her future.</p>

<p>Her character illustrates the theme of discernment—learning to distinguish between what appears secure and what is truly reliable. Carpenter seems like the stable choice, with his solemn demeanor and steady courtship, but his obsessions and risky choices prove troubling. Ducket seems carefree and unreliable, even under suspicion of theft, but proves to be brave, loyal, and trustworthy when tested.</p>

<p>Amy's story also explores how external events—social upheaval, family tragedy—can catalyze personal transformation. The Peasants' Revolt, her father's suicide, and her conversation with Tiffany all contribute to Amy's recognition that she has been wrong about who deserves her trust and loyalty.</p>

<p>The friendship between Amy and Tiffany demonstrates how women of different social classes could form meaningful bonds in medieval London. Despite the gulf between a grocer's daughter and a wealthy merchant's daughter, they find common ground in their struggles over marriage choices and their shared recognition of truth in a world where men hold formal power but women must exercise their own subtle forms of agency.</p>

<p>Finally, Amy embodies a particularly medieval dilemma: the tension between duty (honoring her long betrothal to Carpenter) and desire (her growing realization that Ducket would be a better match). That she ultimately proceeds with her marriage to Carpenter, even after recognizing her true feelings, speaks to the power of social obligations and given word in medieval society. Once a betrothal was made, particularly with parental approval, breaking it was difficult even when hearts changed.</p>
