<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Wistan is the youngest of four sons born to the wealthy Anglo-Saxon merchant <a href="characters/Cerdic-555.html">Cerdic</a> and his East Anglian wife <a href="characters/Elfgiva-Godiva-567.html">Elfgiva</a>. At sixteen years old during the events of "The Rood," he stands apart from his older brothers through his artistic sensibility, gentle nature, and deep devotion to his mother. When his family faces a crisis over the question of conversion to Christianity, Wistan alone shows the courage to defend his mother against his father's rejection of her.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Wistan is described as a "gentle-eyed young fellow with his first beard" at sixteen years old. When he meets Edith in the forest, she recognizes him as having grown from the skinny child she remembered into a young man.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Wistan possesses a sensitive and artistic temperament that distinguishes him from his three older brothers. While his brothers are avid hunters, he "would often good-naturedly join them, but he was just as likely to go for a walk by himself or sit down to carve a piece of wood, which he did well." His mother suspects "he was the one who loved her best."</p>

<p>He demonstrates considerable artistic talent, particularly in drawing. His mother says "He draws a better line than I" when she sends for him to design her embroidery work. The designs he creates are masterful – organic yet abstract plant forms with simple, perfect curves, combined with geometric borders, reflecting the finest traditions of Anglo-Saxon art.</p>

<p>Despite his gentle nature, Wistan shows remarkable courage when defending what he believes is right. When his brothers commiserate with their mother but do nothing to help her, Wistan alone takes action – first confronting his father directly, then making the daring journey to prevent Cerdic's remarriage. He is willing to face his father's fury and violent punishment rather than remain silent about injustice.</p>

<p>His sense of duty is complicated by his love for his mother. When she urges him to "Obey your father, Wistan. It's your duty," he replies, "I will if you will," showing both his devotion to her and his conflicted feelings about the family crisis.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='604-605-family-crisis-and-conversion'>604-605: Family Crisis and Conversion</h3>

<p>The events of "The Rood" take place when Wistan is sixteen years old. His father Cerdic decides to convert to Christianity to improve his business prospects, but his mother Elfgiva refuses, clinging to the old Nordic gods. Cerdic declares he will take a new, younger wife – a girl named Edith, almost fifteen years old – and cast Elfgiva aside.</p>

<p>While his three older brothers merely commiserate with their mother but fear their father too much to act, Wistan is "deeply troubled" by the religious question and grief-stricken by the rejection of his mother. When he comes to talk with Elfgiva, "the sixteen-year-old had broken down with grief."</p>

<h3 id='confronting-his-father'>Confronting His Father</h3>

<p>Three days after breaking down with his mother, Wistan takes the extraordinary step of confronting his father directly. He stands in Cerdic's path on the lane from Thorney and refuses to move aside despite his father's intimidating authority.</p>

<p>"Father, I must talk to you," he says firmly. When Cerdic tries to silence him with cold authority that "made most men tremble," Wistan bravely stands his ground: "It's Mother... You can't treat her like this."</p>

<p>Though Cerdic uses his greater weight to knock the boy aside and strides away "his eyes blazing with fury," this confrontation shows Wistan's moral courage in the face of overwhelming patriarchal power.</p>

<h3 id='journey-to-rochester'>Journey to Rochester</h3>

<p>Wistan takes even more drastic action to save his mother. He disappears for several days, telling one brother he was going hunting, which was unusual since he preferred to hunt with company or not at all. In truth, he undertakes a dangerous solo journey to see Edith, the young woman his father plans to marry.</p>

<p>Rising at dawn, he crosses the ford at Thorney and rides south, then east, traveling all day. He spends the night at Bocton, then continues to Edith's home near Rochester. Rather than approaching the homestead directly, he waits in the woods until he sees her walking alone.</p>

<p>When he calls her name, she recognizes him though they have not seen each other in years. "Don't I know you?" she asks. "You're Wistan."</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath and "suddenly aware of the enormity of what he was doing," he tells her: "I've come to tell you we don't want you." They talk for almost an hour, and he tells her everything about his father and mother. Edith summarizes with insight: "So you've come to try to save your mother? ... I suppose you've come to save me too."</p>

<h3 id='facing-the-consequences'>Facing the Consequences</h3>

<p>When Wistan reappears after several days, Cerdic threatens to whip him. The boy offers unlikely excuses about getting lost while hunting, but Cerdic doesn't believe them and privately assumes it was "some girl," even giving his son "a friendly, if somewhat knowing, look."</p>

<p>A week later, the truth emerges when Edith's father sends word that she has changed her mind and will not marry Cerdic. The merchant immediately guesses what happened. In "an apoplexy of fury he seized a stock whip, and if Wistan had not fled after a few blows, Cerdic might almost have killed him."</p>

<p>For several days after this, "Wistan wisely remained out of sight." Ricola and her husband Offa hide him in their hut one night when Cerdic is searching for him, and Ricola later smuggles him in to see his mother, where he pleads: "I stopped the girl coming. Won't you be baptized now, and go back to him?"</p>

<h3 id='acts-of-kindness-and-artistic-contribution'>Acts of Kindness and Artistic Contribution</h3>

<p>Despite the danger he faces from his father, Wistan continues to help others. He assists with preparations when Bishop Mellitus arrives, "miraculously" appearing "hard at work" when there is much to be done, and Cerdic decides to ignore his presence.</p>

<p>Earlier in the autumn, Wistan had taken a boat upstream with one of his brothers and Offa to collect supplies. During this journey, he serves as a knowledgeable guide, explaining to Offa the geography of the Thames and the names of places like "Chelch Eye" (Chelsea), "Badric's Eye" (Battersea), "Fulla's-ham" (Fulham), and "Kensing's-ton" (Kensington).</p>

<p>His artistic eye is evident when he observes a Frankish longship being unloaded. When Offa admires the graceful, curving line of the keel, Wistan stands beside him, and Offa exclaims: "It's just like the line you drew for the Lady Elfgiva's embroidery," to which Wistan agrees.</p>

<h3 id='resolution-and-final-acts-of-compassion'>Resolution and Final Acts of Compassion</h3>

<p>After his mother is reconciled with his father and converts to Christianity (being baptized with the new name Godiva), family peace is restored. The crisis that tore the family apart is resolved, in part due to Wistan's courageous intervention.</p>

<p>When Offa and Ricola are freed from slavery but left destitute in the snow at Thorney, Wistan demonstrates his compassionate nature one final time. That very night, "a hooded figure on horseback approached their little camp," and "by the firelight they saw the friendly face of young Wistan." He brings them "a haunch of venison" and promises: "I'll come tomorrow to make sure you're all right."</p>

<p>This act of charity toward the young couple, bringing them food in their time of greatest need, exemplifies Wistan's character – artistic, sensitive, but also practically compassionate and brave enough to defy convention to help those in need.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='elfgiva-godiva'>Elfgiva (Godiva)</h3>

<p>Wistan's relationship with his mother is the defining connection of his life during this period. She recognizes that "of all her sons, it was he who most resembled her." She suspects "he was the one who loved her best," and she enjoys his company, often taking him hawking with her at Thorney.</p>

<p>When his mother faces rejection by his father, Wistan is the only one of four sons who takes meaningful action to defend her. He breaks down with grief at her situation, confronts his father on her behalf, and undertakes a dangerous journey to prevent his father's remarriage – all to protect her dignity and position.</p>

<p>His mother, in turn, tries to guide him toward obedience to his father, urging him repeatedly: "Obey your father, Wistan. It's your duty." She also tries to protect him from Cerdic's fury, having "urged him for her sake not to enrage Cerdic further by attacking him."</p>

<h3 id='cerdic'>Cerdic</h3>

<p>Wistan's relationship with his father is complex and fraught during this period. Unlike his older brothers who merely fear their father, Wistan loves his mother enough to openly defy Cerdic's authority. He stands in his path and insists on speaking about the treatment of Elfgiva, even when Cerdic uses all his considerable force of character and physical presence to intimidate him.</p>

<p>Cerdic's response to Wistan's defiance ranges from fury to grudging respect. When he discovers Wistan's role in preventing his marriage to Edith, he nearly beats the boy to death with a stock whip. Yet earlier, when Wistan offered unlikely excuses for his disappearance, Cerdic "grinned to himself" and assumed it was about a girl, even giving him knowing looks.</p>

<p>After the family reconciliation, when Wistan appears to help with preparations for the bishop's visit, Cerdic "decided to ignore it," suggesting he has chosen to move past the conflict rather than continue to punish his son.</p>

<h3 id='offa-and-ricola'>Offa and Ricola</h3>

<p>Wistan shows friendship and compassion toward this young slave couple. He takes Offa with him on the journey upstream to collect supplies, patiently explaining the geography and place names of the Thames region. Later, when the couple is freed but left destitute in winter, Wistan brings them food and promises to check on them, demonstrating practical charity without judgment or hesitation.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Wistan lives during a pivotal moment in English history – the conversion of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to Christianity. In 604-605, when these events take place, King Æthelbert of Kent has embraced Christianity, and missionaries from Rome are working to convert the Germanic peoples who have settled in Britain.</p>

<p>The religious conflict in Wistan's household reflects the larger cultural transformation occurring across Anglo-Saxon England. The old Nordic gods – Woden, Thunor, Frey – are giving way to Christianity, but not without resistance. The pagan concept of <i>Wyrd</i> (fate) that his mother clings to represents the ancient worldview being challenged by the new faith's promise of salvation and divine mercy.</p>

<p>Wistan's artistic talents place him in the tradition of Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship that would eventually blend pagan and Christian artistic traditions. The embroidery designs he creates, with their abstract plant forms and geometric patterns, represent the native artistic tradition that would be absorbed into Christian art, as exemplified by the carved wooden cross that Bishop Mellitus brings – covered with Anglo-Saxon interlaced designs surrounding the figure of Christ.</p>

<p>The merchant class that Wistan's father represents is also significant. Cerdic's trading post at Lundenwic (where the Aldwych now stands) is part of the revival of commerce in post-Roman Britain. The conversion to Christianity is partly motivated by business considerations – it opens trading opportunities with Christian kingdoms on the Continent. This pragmatic aspect of conversion contrasts sharply with the spiritual and emotional dimensions that concern Wistan and his mother.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Wistan embodies several important themes in "London" and particularly in "The Rood":</p>

<p><strong>Courage and Moral Action</strong>: Unlike his older, stronger brothers who merely sympathize with their mother, Wistan takes concrete action despite his youth and lesser physical power. His willingness to confront authority and face consequences for doing what he believes is right marks him as morally courageous in ways his brothers are not.</p>

<p><strong>The Artist in Society</strong>: Wistan represents the sensitive artist in a warrior-merchant culture. His preference for walking alone and carving wood rather than hunting constantly, his mastery of drawing elegant designs, and his aesthetic appreciation of the ship's lines all mark him as someone whose talents and temperament differ from the dominant masculine ideal of his society. Yet he proves that artistic sensitivity need not mean weakness – he shows bravery when it matters most.</p>

<p><strong>Filial Love and Duty</strong>: The conflict between duty to father and love for mother is central to Wistan's story. When his mother tells him his duty is to obey his father, he responds, "I will if you will," showing how the family's religious conflict places impossible demands on children caught between their parents. His ultimate choice to act in defense of his mother, despite his father's commands, suggests that love and justice may sometimes supersede formal obedience.</p>

<p><strong>The Personal Cost of Historical Change</strong>: While "The Rood" is about the large-scale conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity, Wistan's story shows how such historical transformations are experienced in intimate, painful family conflicts. The theological debate between paganism and Christianity becomes, in the family's life, a crisis that nearly destroys them all.</p>

<p><strong>Compassion Across Social Boundaries</strong>: Wistan's kindness to Offa and Ricola, two slaves who have been freed but left with nothing, shows a capacity for compassion that transcends social class. He helps them not because he owes them anything or expects recognition, but simply because they need help and he has the means to provide it.</p>

<p>Wistan's role in the story, though he is only sixteen and not the main character, is crucial. His actions help prevent his father's remarriage, contribute to the eventual reconciliation between his parents, and demonstrate that moral courage can exist in unexpected places. He proves that youth and artistic temperament need not mean passivity in the face of injustice, and his story suggests that the sensitive and creative members of society may possess forms of bravery that differ from but equal the warrior's courage in battle.</p>
