<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Sister Mabel Barnikel is a humble, determined lay sister at the Hospital of St Bartholomew in Smithfield who dedicates her life to caring for the sick and dying. Despite her squinting eye, limited education, and humble origins as a fishmonger's sister, she possesses an earnest devotion to her faith, a fierce loyalty to <a href="characters/Brother-Michael-Bull-1143.html">Brother Michael Bull</a>, and remarkable persistence in doing what she believes is right. She is both comical and admirable, clinging doggedly to religious truths she has carefully worked out while tending patients with practical herbal remedies.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Sister Mabel is short and stout with a perpetual frown of friendly determination. Her most distinctive feature is her left eye, which stares out at a rakish angle. She has red hair, pulled severely back, revealing her descent from the Danish Barnikel family. She wears the grey habit of a lay sister at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Her overall appearance conveys a friendly but confused earnestness, as if she is constantly working hard to make sense of the world around her.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Sister Mabel is defined by her dogged determination and humble devotion. "I have to think very hard," she often says, "because otherwise I get things all muddled up." When she finally understands something, she clings to it with the tenacity of a shipwrecked person holding a raft. She knows her own opinion and is not afraid to speak it, even to powerful men like <a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Alderman Sampson Bull</a>, whom she considers "the wickedest man in London."</p>

<p>Despite many people thinking her a joke and laughing behind her back, she is genuinely humble and earnest. She listens carefully to those she thinks wise, trying hard to make sense of the puzzling world. Her faith is profound but literal – she believes completely in hell, demons, visions, and the power of holy relics and herbal cures.</p>

<p>Sister Mabel never does things by half. When she adopts a cause or a person, her devotion is complete. She is protective of those she loves, particularly Brother Michael, whom she reveres as a saint. She has a practical streak born of treating the sick, understanding that good intentions alone are not enough to prevent sin.</p>

<p>Her blunt honesty can be shocking. When her confessor tries to help her avoid temptation through prayer, she responds frankly: "That's no good, because I probably shall." She speaks her mind without fear, confronting aldermen, demons, and even the Devil himself when she encounters them in her vision.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-religious-calling-c-1161-1170'>Early Life and Religious Calling (c. 1161-1170)</h3>

<p>At age thirteen, during puberty, Mabel learned from her parish priest that women were "the weaker vessel," inferior to men and in special danger of hellfire because of their nature as the defective seed that produces females. The kindly old priest explained that women were necessary as vessels for mankind's continuation but harder to save than men. When she asked what she must do, he suggested that only virgins could easily pass into heaven.</p>

<p>Understanding that she was inferior, that she had some talent for medicine, and that virginity was her likeliest path to heaven, Mabel decided to enter religious life. However, her family were "only fishmongers," too lowly for the great nunneries reserved for noble families and rich merchants. She persisted, eventually finding a place as a lay sister at the humble Hospital of St Bartholomew, where no donation was required.</p>

<h3 id='life-at-st-bartholomews-1170-1190s'>Life at St Bartholomew's (1170-1190s)</h3>

<p>Sister Mabel found happiness at the hospital, tending the sick with herbal cures. Her larder became a treasure-trove of jars, pots and boxes. "Dandelions to clean the blood," she would explain, "cress for baldness, wort for fever, water lilies for dysentery." She also relied on holy water from the priory and pilgrimage to holy relics for truly serious cases, knowing these were the only hope for cure and salvation.</p>

<h3 id='meeting-brother-michael-june-1170'>Meeting Brother Michael (June 1170)</h3>

<p>From the moment <a href="characters/Brother-Michael-Bull-1143.html">Brother Michael Bull</a> arrived at the hospital in June 1170, having left Westminster Abbey, Mabel felt sure he was a saint. Why else would a rich merchant's son choose the poor hospital over the wealthy priory? She admired his quiet, stately ways and his learning. When others, including his wicked brother, thought him a fool, she grew protective. "He's just too good for them," she would mutter.</p>

<h3 id='the-confrontation-with-alderman-bull-september-1170'>The Confrontation with Alderman Bull (September 1170)</h3>

<p>When Brother Michael tried to reconcile with his brother <a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Sampson Bull</a>, Mabel accompanied him. She knew the alderman was avaricious, that he scorned his saintly brother, and that he planned to rob a crusader with help from a Jew. When Bull declared "I don't believe in God," Mabel gasped – here was final proof of his wickedness.</p>

<p>With characteristic boldness, she confronted him directly: "You're a very wicked man. You'll go to hell with the Jews. You know that? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Why don't you give money to the hospital instead of robbing pilgrims who are a lot better than you could ever hope to be?"</p>

<p>Bull exploded in rage, damning the hospital, the monks, the crusaders, and threatening to become a Jew himself if he ever needed a religion. In his fury, he made an astonishing challenge to his brother: if Michael could swear on his deathbed that he had never broken his three monastic vows, Bull would give the estate of Bocton to St Bartholomew's.</p>

<p>Mabel, despite the disaster of the confrontation, had faith. "You'll see," she assured Brother Michael, "the hospital will get that legacy."</p>

<h3 id='the-vision-at-smithfield-april-1172'>The Vision at Smithfield (April 1172)</h3>

<p>On a bright, damp April morning, crossing Smithfield, Mabel witnessed an extraordinary vision. A glittering procession of knights and ladies on horseback appeared, making no sound as they vanished into the ground near the city gate. A second crowd followed – ragged, wan souls accompanied by demons with bird-like legs, clawed feet, curved tails, and tridents.</p>

<p>She questioned a green-and-white demon, who explained these were living human souls – those in front going toward heaven, those behind being led toward hell and temptation. The demon revealed: "We have them in our hands already. We're leading them towards temptation, and then to their doom." When she asked if any would be saved, he chuckled: "A few. Only a few."</p>

<p>Mabel saw many people she knew in the doomed procession, including <a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Alderman Bull</a> sitting backwards on a horse, his face and hands covered in boils. But nothing prepared her for the sight of Brother Michael, walking with his head bowed in sorrow and shame, apparently bound for hell. She cried out and ran beside the procession, but though his head seemed to raise once, he could not hear her. The vision convinced her that the Devil had plans for Brother Michael – and perhaps for her too.</p>

<h3 id='the-jewish-riot-september-1189'>The Jewish Riot (September 1189)</h3>

<p>When Richard I's coronation sparked anti-Jewish riots in London, Mabel accompanied Brother Michael and <a href="characters/Pentecost-Silversleeves-1145.html">Pentecost Silversleeves</a> through the city to protect Abraham, a Jewish moneylender. Though not detailed in her perspective, this event showed her continued devotion to helping Brother Michael in his mission of mercy, even amid dangerous mob violence.</p>

<h3 id='adopting-adam-ducket-early-1190'>Adopting Adam Ducket (Early 1190)</h3>

<p>When <a href="characters/Simon-1140.html">Simon the armourer</a> died suddenly, leaving a widow and infant son, Sister Mabel virtually adopted the little boy, Adam. She arrived at her brother's house with the child in her arms and announced, "Here's a playmate for our babies." Adam, with his webbed hands and white tuft of hair, was soon dubbed 'little duck' or 'ducket' by the Barnikel family. Mabel visited Adam and his mother almost daily, delighting in her role as his protector.</p>

<p>She also helped arrange for Adam's inheritance of his father's strips of land near Windsor, ensuring the widow and child had some provision for the future.</p>

<h3 id='temptation-and-rejection-christmas-1189'>Temptation and Rejection (Christmas 1189)</h3>

<p>For weeks after witnessing Brother Michael's athletic build when his cassock was ripped off while stopping a runaway stallion at Smithfield, Mabel experienced physical desire for the first time in her life. She was acutely aware of his physical presence – his footfall, the smell of sweat on his habit, his matted hair. She knew it was the Devil who sent this desire and prayed constantly, but found herself powerless.</p>

<p>She went to her confessor at St Paul's, explaining her situation. When he advised prayer, she responded with brutal honesty: "That's no good, because I probably shall."</p>

<p>At the Christmas feast at St Bartholomew's, having drunk more than she realized, Mabel sat with Brother Michael by the brazier in the cloister. She asked if he had ever loved a woman, then pulled up her habit above the knee, showing him her leg. "I used to think my legs were all right," she said. "What do you think?"</p>

<p>Brother Michael, not shocked but touched, realized this was the first and only sexual advance Mabel would make in her life. He kissed her gently on the forehead and remarked: "A fine leg indeed, Sister Mabel, with which to serve God." Then he quietly left the cloister and walked out into Smithfield.</p>

<p>Two days later, Mabel told her confessor cheerfully: "It's over for me. I shall go to hell and there's nothing you can do about it. But Brother Michael's still all right."</p>

<h3 id='confrontation-over-kiddles-april-1190'>Confrontation Over Kiddles (April 1190)</h3>

<p>When <a href="characters/Pentecost-Silversleeves-1145.html">Pentecost Silversleeves</a>, now serving as an Exchequer clerk loyal to <a href="characters/Sampson-Bull-1140.html">Alderman Bull</a>, ordered her brother's fishing nets removed from the Thames without compensation despite his having paid handsomely for them, Mabel protested. "It's not fair," she said. Her brother reminded Silversleeves he had paid for those nets, but Pentecost replied smoothly there would be no compensation.</p>

<p>"Then there's one law for the rich and one for the poor," Mabel stated in disgust. Silversleeves smiled and agreed: "Of course."</p>

<h3 id='caring-for-the-poor-curate-autumn-1190'>Caring for the Poor Curate (Autumn 1190)</h3>

<p>Sister Mabel regularly visited the poor, sickly curate of St Lawrence Silversleeves church and his family. The thirty-five-year-old curate had grey, sparse hair and suffered dizzy spells. His wife, working in the bakery next door, had varicose veins. Their two daughters were sallow and reminded Mabel of broken candles. The family lived in misery in a huddled tenement behind the church, paid a pittance by the Silversleeves family who controlled the church's endowment.</p>

<p>Mabel brought herbal medicines: wood lettuce for failing vision, betony for giddy spells, savine for swollen feet, and whey bread for worms. After spending an hour with them, she emerged determined: "Damn that Silversleeves. He must do something for them. I shall make him."</p>

<h3 id='the-demon-returns-autumn-1190'>The Demon Returns (Autumn 1190)</h3>

<p>While searching for Pentecost Silversleeves to confront him about the curate, Mabel spotted him talking to Brother Michael near the gateway to St Bartholomew's. As she approached, she stopped in astonishment. Standing behind the two men, as clear and solid as the priory itself, was the same green and white demon she had spoken to in her vision years before – the one with the bird-like face, curving tail, and trident.</p>

<p>This second sighting of the demon confirmed her long-held fear that the Devil had plans for Brother Michael, and that evil forces were working to ensnare the gentle monk.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='brother-michael-bull'>Brother Michael Bull</h3>

<p>Sister Mabel's relationship with Brother Michael is the central one of her life. She reveres him as a saint, admires his learning and wisdom, and grows fiercely protective when others mock him. From their first meeting in June 1170, she considers him too good for the world around him. When she has her vision showing him bound for hell, it horrifies her more than seeing herself damned would have.</p>

<p>Her feelings deepen into physical desire after seeing his body, but when she makes her single sexual advance at Christmas 1189, his gentle rejection leaves her convinced he is still pure. She accepts that she may go to hell, but takes comfort that "Brother Michael's still all right." Throughout their twenty-year acquaintance, she serves as his devoted companion, fellow worker, and spiritual guardian, always watching for the Devil's snares.</p>

<h3 id='alderman-sampson-bull'>Alderman Sampson Bull</h3>

<p>Mabel views Bull as "the wickedest man in London." She is outraged by his plan to take advantage of a crusader, his scorn for his saintly brother, and above all his declaration that he doesn't believe in God. She confronts him directly despite his power, telling him he'll go to hell with the Jews and that he ought to be ashamed.</p>

<p>Though their confrontation in September 1170 ends badly with Bull's furious explosion, Mabel never wavers in her conviction that his promise to leave Bocton to the hospital if Michael dies with his vows intact will come true. Her simple faith in divine justice assures her that good will ultimately triumph over Bull's wickedness.</p>

<h3 id='the-barnikel-family'>The Barnikel Family</h3>

<p>Mabel's relationship with her fishmonger brother and his family provides her with a connection to the secular world. She adopts Adam Ducket into the Barnikel household as a playmate for her brother's children, visiting frequently. When Silversleeves orders her brother's nets removed without compensation, she protests vigorously on behalf of her family, showing she has not completely separated from worldly concerns despite her religious vocation.</p>

<h3 id='adam-ducket'>Adam Ducket</h3>

<p>Though still an infant during this period, Adam becomes Mabel's adopted son in all but name. She virtually adopts him after his father Simon's death, bringing him to her brother's house and visiting almost daily. She also ensures he receives his inheritance of land strips near Windsor, showing practical care for his future welfare alongside her spiritual devotion.</p>

<h3 id='pentecost-silversleeves'>Pentecost Silversleeves</h3>

<p>Mabel views Silversleeves with contempt, particularly when she sees his callous treatment of her brother over the kiddles and his neglect of the poor curate at his family church. She is not intimidated by his position or education, confronting him directly about injustice. When she sees the demon standing behind him and Brother Michael in autumn 1190, it confirms her sense that Silversleeves is part of the evil forces threatening the monk she loves.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Sister Mabel's life illustrates several aspects of religious life in late 12th-century England. As a woman from the artisan class, she faced severe limitations in entering religious orders. The great nunneries were reserved for noble and wealthy merchant families, and the Church's view of women as "weaker vessels" more prone to sin meant little interest in expanding female orders. Her position as a lay sister at St Bartholomew's Hospital represented one of the few paths available for humble women seeking religious life.</p>

<p>Her herbal medicine practice reflects the medieval blend of practical healing and spiritual remedies. Hospitals like St Bartholomew's, originally hospices for pilgrims, had evolved into institutions caring for the sick, blind, crippled, and elderly. The care was often rudimentary, with multiple patients sharing beds, but dedicated individuals like Mabel provided real comfort and attempted cures through the herbal knowledge passed down through generations.</p>

<p>Mabel's visions of souls being led toward heaven or hell by demons reflect the vivid medieval imagination regarding the afterlife. Such visions were taken seriously in an age when the reality of heaven and hell, angels and demons, was unquestioned. Her encounters with the green and white demon, far from seeming fantastic to her contemporaries, would have been recognized as genuine spiritual experiences.</p>

<p>The contrast between the wealthy Priory of St Bartholomew with its "canons regular" living in pleasant comfort and the humble hospital with its lay brothers and sisters highlights the class divisions within religious life. Mabel's choice of the hospital over seeking advancement elsewhere demonstrates her genuine humility and devotion to service.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Sister Mabel embodies the theme of humble faith confronting a corrupt world. Despite her confused eye and muddled thinking, she sees moral truth with absolute clarity. She recognizes wickedness in the powerful Alderman Bull and injustice in Silversleeves's treatment of the poor, speaking truth to power without fear.</p>

<p>Her character illustrates the medieval church's contradictory attitudes toward women. Taught that she is inferior, defective seed, and specially vulnerable to damnation, she nevertheless finds dignity and purpose in religious service. Her practical competence as a healer and her moral courage belie the doctrine of female weakness, even as she accepts it as truth.</p>

<p>The tension between Mabel's sexual awakening and her religious vocation explores the human cost of celibacy. Her single attempt at seduction – showing her leg to Brother Michael – is both comical and poignant, the only sexual overture she will make in her entire life. Her frank acknowledgment that prayer alone won't prevent sin shows a practical understanding of human nature that transcends her limited education.</p>

<p>Her visions of souls being led toward damnation, particularly her horror at seeing Brother Michael among them, express the medieval preoccupation with salvation. The demons she encounters are not abstract theological concepts but vivid, physical beings actively working to ensnare the living. Her sighting of the demon behind Silversleeves and Brother Michael years later suggests either genuine prophetic sight or a psychological projection of her fears for the monk she loves.</p>

<p>Mabel's adoption of Adam Ducket demonstrates that even those who have taken religious vows retain human needs for family and connection. Unable to have children of her own, she virtually adopts the orphaned boy, showing that maternal instinct transcends vows of celibacy and religious separation from the world.</p>

<p>Most significantly, Sister Mabel represents the persistence of genuine religious devotion amid institutional corruption. While the great monasteries like Westminster forge documents and the Silversleeves family neglects their poor curate, Mabel tends the dying, distributes herbal cures, and holds fast to simple truths about heaven, hell, and salvation. In her humble constancy, she embodies a purer form of Christianity than that practiced by many of her social superiors.</p>
