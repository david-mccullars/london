<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Martin Fleming is a poor young servant of Flemish descent whose wrongful conviction for theft brings him face-to-face with death by hanging in 1295 London. His puny, concave physical frame belies an inner obstinacy as immovable as a mountain. When his beloved Joan sacrifices her reputation to save his life through an extraordinary medieval legal loophole, Martin's rigid pride and views about female purity are tested to their limits. His story culminates in a dramatic last-minute royal pardon at the gallows and a wedding that brings together the most unlikely collection of witnesses in London.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Martin Fleming possesses a distinctive and unfortunate physical appearance. He is only one inch taller than Joan, his beloved, making him quite short. His most notable feature is his peculiar shape: in every place where most people bulge outwards, Martin caves inward. His chest is sunken, his face reminds observers of the inside of a spoon, and his whole appearance is so puny and concave that most people assume he must be weak-minded as well. His family shares these concave features, as evidenced when William Bull observes "a group of people with sad, strangely concave faces" at the execution and correctly identifies them as Martin's family.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Despite his unprepossessing appearance, Martin Fleming possesses a powerful inner strength: a secret obstinacy that, once set, is as immovable as a mountain. This stubborn pride shapes his entire personality and becomes both his defining characteristic and nearly his downfall.</p>

<p>By age eighteen, after being mocked and rejected by girls who called out "Never been kissed. Doesn't know how," Martin constructed elaborate psychological defenses. He convinced himself that he despised women, dismissing them as "only women. Fickle, weaker vessels" as the preachers called them. He viewed feminine smiles, kisses, and sexuality as "all the work of the Devil." These defenses grew so strong that by young adulthood he had hardened into a proud, unkissed young man who believed himself above such earthly concerns.</p>

<p>Yet Joan's quiet love penetrated these defenses entirely. Once Martin allowed himself to love her, his devotion became absolute and protective. He worshipped her, giving her constant attention and small presents. His courtship revealed a tender, dedicated side beneath his defensive pride. However, his love remained rigidly idealized—he believed Joan was the only chaste woman in an otherwise corrupt female world.</p>

<p>Martin's sense of honor and duty manifests when he rushes to defend his master's property from thieves despite his mistreatment, making noise deliberately to chase them away. This same quality makes him completely incapable of lying or deception, which contributes to his conviction when he cannot effectively defend himself against false accusations.</p>

<p>His most severe limitation is his inflexibility. When confronted with Joan's sacrifice—her apparent transformation into a prostitute to save his life—Martin's pride and rigid views about female purity initially paralyze him. Even facing death with a noose around his neck, he cannot immediately accept that circumstances might be other than they appear, nearly costing both their lives.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-family-background'>Early Life and Family Background</h3>

<p>Martin Fleming's family were Flemings from Flanders, part of the common wave of Flemish immigrants to London who typically prospered as merchants, weavers, and artisans. However, Martin's family did not share this success. His father was a poor horner whose trade—thinning horn until translucent for use as lantern casings—brought only a pittance. When an opportunity arose for Martin to work for a wealthy Italian moneylender, his father urged him to take it, hoping the position might lead to better prospects despite its humble nature.</p>

<h3 id='service-to-the-italian'>Service to the Italian</h3>

<p>Martin worked as a servant to an Italian moneylender who lived alone on Lombard Street, the center of London's new Christian moneylending industry that had replaced the expelled Jewish financiers. The Italian paid Martin well, though grudgingly, and used him for all manner of errands. However, the relationship was troubled from the start. Whether due to language barriers or natural mistrust, the Italian constantly accused Martin of cheating—of loitering when delivering messages or pocketing money from market purchases. Martin endured this treatment because he had something else on his mind: Joan.</p>

<h3 id='meeting-and-courting-joan'>Meeting and Courting Joan</h3>

<p>When Martin was about eighteen, after six months working for the Italian, he noticed Joan sitting outside her father's saddle-painting workshop at the bottom of Bread Street. Some silent inner voice prompted him to stop and speak with her. He returned the next day, and the next. Joan's lack of other suitors gave Martin confidence he had never possessed before. As his confidence grew, he became protective of her, thrilling at this newfound sense of strength.</p>

<p>Martin's courtship was unwavering and devoted. Not a week passed without some small present; he matched her moods whether happy or sad and paid her more attention than anyone ever had. Within six months, they both wanted to marry. However, financial reality intervened. Joan's father, a decent craftsman who painted elaborate wooden saddles for the rich, had little dowry to offer and was reluctant to see his daughter marry someone with such poor prospects. Martin's horner father had even less. After a meeting between the two fathers, they agreed the young couple should wait two years in hopes Martin might improve his position, secretly hoping they might change their minds.</p>

<h3 id='the-disaster-wrongful-accusation'>The Disaster: Wrongful Accusation</h3>

<p>One October evening when his master was away, Martin broke curfew rules to slip out to a tavern. Upon returning two hours later to the darkened Lombard Street house, he surprised two thieves. Without thinking of his own safety, focused only on protecting his master's property, Martin rushed toward them making such noise that they fled. He chased them up an alley where one dropped a small bag, then they vanished. Martin picked up the bag and began walking home.</p>

<p>Minutes later, a beadle emerged from shadows to question Martin about being in the streets after curfew and inspected the bag. Inside were several gold ornaments the Italian had kept hidden. When the Italian returned the next day, nothing could persuade him that Martin had not attempted robbery. At the trial, the Italian testified: "I've caught this young man trying to rob me before"—a complete fabrication but enough for the justices to find Martin guilty of theft, a capital crime.</p>

<h3 id='imprisonment-at-newgate'>Imprisonment at Newgate</h3>

<p>Martin spent a week in Newgate prison, one of three main city prisons by the western wall. The regime was harsh: prisoners paid the gaoler for food, or family and friends passed food and clothing through a grille, or they starved unless passers-by showed mercy. Martin's family fed him and Joan visited daily, but he had no hope. Only rich people could buy royal pardons, and that option was impossible for someone of his station. He resigned himself to death, finding that no prayer would form in his mind despite the gaoler's advice to "say your prayers."</p>

<h3 id='the-whorehouse-plan'>The Whorehouse Plan</h3>

<p>Unbeknownst to Martin, Joan had encountered the Dogget sisters—identical twin prostitutes from Southwark—who learned her story and concocted an extraordinary plan based on an obscure medieval law: if a condemned man agreed to marry a prostitute, he could receive a pardon. Joan would register as a prostitute at the Dog's Head brothel in Southwark, then claim Martin at the gallows. The Dogget sisters promised to protect her virginity through the required registration night.</p>

<p>Joan sent her brother to Newgate with a cryptic message for Martin: "Everything is going to be all right. Nothing will be what it seems. But you must trust me." Martin received this message with confusion, having no idea what it could mean.</p>

<h3 id='rescue-at-the-gallows'>Rescue at the Gallows</h3>

<p>On the morning of his scheduled execution, Martin was chained with four other condemned men in a tumbrel at Newgate. He saw his family with their characteristic concave faces, and Joan's family members—short, solemn craftsmen with large round heads. As the cart prepared to depart for Smithfield and the hanging trees, Joan appeared in the humiliating white-striped garb of a common prostitute, barefoot, carrying lighted candles of penitence.</p>

<p>In a clear voice heard by the entire crowd, she proclaimed: "I am Joan, a whore. Will Martin Fleming marry me?" Martin's face showed horror and stupefaction. He could not comprehend how his pure Joan could appear as a whore. The message—"Nothing will be what it seems. But you must trust me"—should have prepared him, but his rigid beliefs about female purity paralyzed him.</p>

<p>The king's justice, though surprised, confirmed the law was valid. Complications arose when <a href="characters/William-Bull-1255.html">William Bull</a> stepped forward claiming he had lain with Joan, and <a href="characters/Dionysius-Silversleeves-1266.html">Dionysius Silversleeves</a> loudly insisted he had as well, and when the Italian moneylender protested it was all play-acting. Through the chaos, Joan stared at Martin, desperately willing him to trust her and understand.</p>

<p>Finally, the justice asked Martin directly: "If she is [a whore], are you ready to marry her? It means you go free, you know. You won't hang." Martin only stared ahead, speechless, unable to reconcile his idealized image of Joan with the reality before him, frozen by his obstinate pride even as his life hung in the balance.</p>

<h3 id='the-royal-pardon'>The Royal Pardon</h3>

<p>As Martin stood paralyzed, William Bull—despite his own troubles with the fishmonger <a href="characters/Waldus-Barnikel-1248.html">Waldus Barnikel</a>—swallowed his pride and rode to Barnikel to beg for help. Barnikel, who happened to have seen King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward I</a> the previous day, rode immediately to petition the king. Edward I, in generous mood, granted a royal pardon.</p>

<p>A quarter hour later, at Smithfield, Martin Fleming stood under the elm tree with the noose already around his neck when he saw William Bull, Alderman Barnikel, and a royal clerk riding swiftly toward them crying "Royal pardon."</p>

<h3 id='marriage-and-reconciliation'>Marriage and Reconciliation</h3>

<p>The marriage of Martin and Joan Fleming took place a few days later in the porch of St Mary Overy church in Southwark. Though Martin was by then fully satisfied of his wife's purity—a long conversation with Bull had confirmed that Joan had never actually lain with any man—overcoming his horror at Joan's action required considerable effort. His pride struggled against the fact that his wife, even temporarily and in name only, had become a registered prostitute.</p>

<p>Neither Martin's family nor Joan's attended the wedding, unable to overcome their shock and shame. The ceremony thus featured the most unlikely collection of witnesses: Alderman Barnikel stood by Martin, William Bull gave the bride away, and the two Dogget sisters acted as bridesmaids. The priest thought he had never seen anything like it. The final irony, as observers noted, was that Martin Fleming was the only man in the church that day who had never slept with either of the Dogget sisters.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='joan-fleming'>Joan Fleming</h3>

<p>Martin's relationship with Joan is the defining force of his life and the engine of his story. Before meeting her, he had constructed elaborate defenses against women, dismissing them as fickle and unchaste after experiencing mockery and rejection. Joan penetrated these defenses completely, becoming the sole exception to his misogynistic worldview—the one pure woman in a corrupt world.</p>

<p>His love for Joan is absolute, protective, and worshipful. He courted her with unwavering devotion, giving constant attention and small presents, providing emotional support in all her moods. No one had ever paid her such attention before, and his devotion won her completely despite his poor prospects and physical appearance.</p>

<p>However, Martin's love is also rigid and idealized. He cannot conceive of Joan as a complex person who might make unconventional choices for good reasons. When she appears as a prostitute to save his life, his inability to see beyond surface appearances nearly destroys them both. Only Joan's desperate faith that he would remember her message—"Nothing will be what it seems. But you must trust me"—keeps her going through the ordeal.</p>

<p>After the rescue and a lengthy conversation with William Bull explaining the full truth, Martin becomes "fully satisfied" of Joan's purity. Yet the text suggests his adjustment remains difficult—it required a "long conversation" to overcome his horror, and the absence of both families from their wedding indicates the lasting social cost of Joan's sacrifice, a cost Martin must live with despite his love for her.</p>

<h3 id='the-italian-moneylender'>The Italian Moneylender</h3>

<p>Martin's relationship with his master is characterized by perpetual mistrust and accusation despite Martin's honest service. The Italian, a widower whose son runs their Italian business, constantly suspects Martin of cheating whether from language difficulties or natural temperament. These unjust accusations wear on Martin, yet he endures them because he needs the position to have any chance of marrying Joan.</p>

<p>When Martin actually saves the Italian's property from thieves, the Italian repays this loyalty with the ultimate betrayal: false testimony at trial that leads to Martin's death sentence. The Italian's lie—"I've caught this young man trying to rob me before"—reveals the fundamental injustice of Martin's situation and highlights the vulnerability of poor servants to their masters' whims. The Italian later appears at the execution to protest the rescue attempt, demonstrating his vindictive determination to see Martin hang.</p>

<h3 id='the-dogget-sisters-isobel-and-margery'>The Dogget Sisters (Isobel and Margery)</h3>

<p>Though Martin has no direct relationship with the identical twin prostitutes who devise Joan's rescue plan, they become the unlikely heroines of his story. Their promise to protect Joan's virginity while she registers at the brothel makes the entire scheme possible. At his wedding, they serve as bridesmaids in the absence of actual family—a detail highlighting both the unconventional nature of his rescue and the authentic kindness of these disreputable women. The final ironic note that Martin "was the only man in the church that day who had never slept with either of the Dogget sisters" emphasizes his outsider status even among this motley group of saviors.</p>

<h3 id='william-bull-and-waldus-barnikel'>William Bull and Waldus Barnikel</h3>

<p>Martin benefits from the intervention of two men he barely knows. William Bull plays along with Joan's plan by falsely claiming to have slept with her, then later explains the full truth to Martin in a lengthy conversation that helps him overcome his horror. Most remarkably, Bull—despite being in the middle of a fierce rivalry with fishmonger Waldus Barnikel—humbles himself to beg Barnikel for help saving Martin's life.</p>

<p>Barnikel's willingness to ride immediately to petition the king demonstrates a fundamental decency that transcends social boundaries. At the wedding, Barnikel stands beside Martin while Bull gives away the bride, creating a scene that crosses all normal social divisions. These two patrician figures bracket Martin's ceremony, their presence both honoring and highlighting his lowly status.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Martin Fleming's story unfolds in London during the final years of the thirteenth century under the long reign of Edward I (1272-1307), known as "Edward Longshanks" and the "Hammer of the Scots." This was a period of significant social and economic transition in medieval London.</p>

<h3 id='flemish-immigration'>Flemish Immigration</h3>

<p>As his name indicates, Martin's family were Flemings from Flanders, part of a large wave of immigration from the great cloth-making territories between France and the German lands. Flanders was England's major trading partner and the greatest source of immigrants to the island. Flemish mercenary soldiers, merchants, weavers, and artisans commonly came to London, usually merging easily into the English mainstream and often prospering. However, not all Flemish immigrants succeeded—Martin's family represents those who remained in poverty despite the generally favorable prospects for their countrymen.</p>

<h3 id='the-expulsion-of-the-jews-and-rise-of-italian-moneylenders'>The Expulsion of the Jews and Rise of Italian Moneylenders</h3>

<p>Martin's employment by an Italian moneylender reflects a major shift in English financial life. In 1290, just five years before Martin's story, King Edward I expelled the entire Jewish community from England. For generations, Jewish financiers had provided essential lending services, as canon law theoretically prohibited Christians from charging interest (though this prohibition was inconsistently applied). The Jewish community had been systematically persecuted and financially ruined through repeated royal fines, and once Italian Christian banking houses—promoted by the Vatican—had established themselves, Edward found he no longer needed the Jews. He canceled remaining Jewish debts and expelled them, pleasing the Pope and the many barons who owed money.</p>

<p>The Italian moneylenders who replaced them operated from Lombard Street, named for the Lombardy region from which many came. Martin's master represents this new class of Christian financiers. The old Jewish doctor who had treated venereal diseases with mercury was gone, replaced by less knowledgeable Christian practitioners. The expulsion had disrupted community services while maintaining the financial extraction that had made the Jews unpopular.</p>

<h3 id='medieval-legal-system-and-capital-punishment'>Medieval Legal System and Capital Punishment</h3>

<p>Martin's experience reveals the harsh realities of medieval justice for the poor. Accusation by a master, supported by perjured testimony, was sufficient for conviction of a capital crime. The poor had no access to expensive legal representation or to royal pardons, which rich people could purchase. Imprisonment at Newgate meant depending on family to provide food through a grille or slowly starving. The spectacle of public execution at Smithfield served both as punishment and popular entertainment, with crowds gathering to watch the condemned in their tumbrel cart.</p>

<p>The obscure law that allows Joan to save Martin—a condemned man could be pardoned if he agreed to marry a prostitute—represents one of many peculiar provisions in medieval English law designed to offer mercy in specific circumstances. The king's justice's comment "I've always heard of this sort of thing but I never thought I'd see it" suggests the law was known but rarely invoked.</p>

<h3 id='the-bishops-stew-houses'>The Bishop's Stew-Houses</h3>

<p>Joan's rescue plan depends on the regulated prostitution industry in Southwark, specifically the eighteen brothels (stew-houses) along Bankside owned and administered by the Bishop of Winchester. These establishments operated under regulations drawn up in the reign of Henry II by an Archbishop of Canterbury (specifically Thomas Becket as assistant), creating a legal, inspected, and licensed prostitution system. The bishop's bailiff registered prostitutes, enforced health inspections, and maintained order in "the Liberty of the Clink"—the feudal jurisdiction including the bishop's manor, the Clink prison, and the brothels.</p>

<p>This ecclesiastical ownership of prostitution may seem paradoxical to modern sensibilities, but medieval authorities saw it as pragmatic regulation of an inevitable social reality. The system ensured health inspections (prostitutes with disease were expelled), protected prostitutes from some exploitation, and generated substantial revenue. London's own licensed brothels in Cock's Lane near St Bartholomew's operated under the same Winchester regulations, and prostitutes were colloquially called "Winchester Geese."</p>

<h3 id='curfew-and-urban-control'>Curfew and Urban Control</h3>

<p>Martin's initial trouble stems from breaking curfew—the medieval regulation requiring common folk to be indoors after dark unless carrying their master's permission. While enforcement was minimal (just two sergeants at city gates and each ward's beadle) and compliance casual, the curfew represented authorities' attempts to control the increasingly crowded and diverse urban population. London was experiencing explosive growth in the late thirteenth century, with immigrants flooding in from across Europe and England, creating anxieties about crime and disorder.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<h3 id='appearance-versus-reality'>Appearance Versus Reality</h3>

<p>Martin's story revolves around the fundamental theme of appearance versus reality, embodied in Joan's message: "Nothing will be what it seems. But you must trust me." His physical appearance—puny, concave, weak-looking—conceals an inner obstinacy as immovable as a mountain. Joan's appearance as a prostitute conceals her preserved virginity. William Bull and Dionysius Silversleeves claim to have slept with Joan when they have not. The Italian's respectable position as a moneylender conceals his dishonesty and vindictiveness. Even the Dogget sisters, dismissed by society as mere prostitutes, reveal themselves capable of elaborate planning, loyalty, and genuine kindness.</p>

<p>Martin's near-fatal flaw is his inability to see past surfaces. His rigid belief in Joan's purity becomes paradoxically dangerous when she appears impure. The very quality that made him idealize her—his absolute faith in her chasteness—nearly prevents him from accepting her sacrifice. The story suggests that truth often requires looking beyond immediate appearances, that trust must sometimes operate despite rather than because of what we see.</p>

<h3 id='pride-and-stubbornness'>Pride and Stubbornness</h3>

<p>Martin embodies both the strength and danger of stubborn pride. His "secret obstinacy that, once set, was as immovable as a mountain" allows him to survive mockery, construct self-protective defenses, and maintain his devotion to Joan despite discouragement. Yet this same quality nearly destroys him at the gallows. When flexible thinking and quick acceptance are required, Martin's pride locks him into paralysis. The story demonstrates that character traits operate as both strengths and weaknesses depending on circumstances—the stubbornness that protects can also imprison.</p>

<h3 id='social-vulnerability-and-justice'>Social Vulnerability and Justice</h3>

<p>Martin's wrongful conviction illustrates the profound vulnerability of the poor in medieval society. His honest service means nothing against his master's false testimony. He has no access to legal representation, no ability to purchase a pardon, no social standing to make authorities question the accusation. The Italian's word automatically outweighs Martin's truth. His rescue depends entirely on the intervention of social superiors—Bull and Barnikel—and on the king's whim. The story reveals how medieval justice operated differently for different classes, with the poor having essentially no recourse against false accusation by their betters.</p>

<h3 id='redemption-through-unlikely-sources'>Redemption Through Unlikely Sources</h3>

<p>Martin's salvation comes from the most unexpected quarters: two prostitutes devise the plan, a merchant and his rival fishmonger (men Martin barely knows) secure the pardon, and an obscure medieval law provides the legal mechanism. His own family, Joan's family, respectable society—none of these help. Instead, the disreputable, the unlikely, and the socially marginal provide rescue. The wedding scene crystallizes this reversal: prostitutes serve as bridesmaids, rivals stand together, and the only virgin present is the supposed whore. Rutherford suggests that redemption often comes from sources conventional morality would dismiss, that crisis reveals who truly possesses virtue regardless of social position.</p>

<h3 id='loves-transformative-and-testing-power'>Love's Transformative and Testing Power</h3>

<p>Joan's love for Martin transforms her from a modest craftsman's daughter into someone willing to sacrifice her reputation, her family, and her entire social standing. Martin's love gives him the confidence and sense of strength he never previously possessed. Yet love also tests them severely. Joan must trust that Martin will understand and accept her sacrifice despite knowing his rigid views. Martin must overcome his deepest beliefs about female purity to accept Joan's gift of life. Their story suggests that genuine love requires both parties to grow beyond their limitations, that love tests as much as it transforms, and that the strongest love survives not by avoiding crisis but by navigating through it.</p>

<h3 id='london-as-a-world-of-extremes'>London as a World of Extremes</h3>

<p>Martin's London contains grotesque disparities: Italian financiers and starving horners, regulated church-owned brothels and pious executions, merciful obscure laws and arbitrary capital sentences. The bishop owns prostitutes, the king pardons at whim, families abandon children over social stigma, and prostitutes show more loyalty than blood relatives. This London is simultaneously brutal and merciful, rigid and flexible, respectable and corrupt. Martin's story traverses all these extremes—from Lombard Street to Newgate to Bankside to Smithfield—revealing a city where survival depends on navigating impossible contradictions and where salvation requires accepting help from every social stratum.</p>

<blockquote class='character-quote'>
<div class='quote-text'>"Martin Fleming was only one inch taller than the girl he loved, but it was his curious shape which people really noticed. For in every place where most people bulged outwards, Martin Fleming caved in. His little chest was sunken; his face reminded you of the inside of a spoon. His whole appearance was so puny and concave that everyone assumed he must be weak of mind as well. Few knew that within the soul of Martin Fleming was a secret obstinacy that, once set, was as immovable as a mountain."</div>

<h2 id='key-quotes-said-by-martin-fleming'>Key Quotes Said by Martin Fleming</h2>

<p>Martin is notably given almost no direct dialogue in the narrative, which is itself significant. His silence reflects his social powerlessness and his paralyzed state throughout the crisis. He cannot defend himself at trial, cannot explain himself to Joan through her brother's visit to prison, and most critically, stands mute at the gallows when speech would save his life. His story is one in which things happen to him and others act on his behalf while he remains voiceless—a narrative choice that emphasizes the vulnerability and powerlessness of his position as a poor servant in medieval London.</p>
