<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Rowland Bull is a devout lawyer from a brewing family who rises to serve in the Chancellor's office during Henry VIII's reign, only to become trapped in the religious turmoil of the Reformation. A conscientious, educated man of intense nervous constitution, he is caught between his loyalty to the king and his Catholic faith during the crisis over the Royal Supremacy. His life is saved through an extraordinary deception at the Tower, allowing him to live out his days peacefully as a schoolmaster in Rochester under an assumed name.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Rowland is described as having a stout build with dark hair and a prematurely balding head – features that made him resemble his brother-in-law <a href="characters/Peter-Meredith-1488.html">Peter Meredith</a>. Unlike his fair-haired, blue-eyed brothers who maintained the typical Bull family appearance, Rowland "with his dark hair and balding head looked more like a Celtic Welshman." His son Jonathan inherits his father's "fine, dark hair and his pale, intense little face."</p>

<p>He has a pale complexion and an intense, nervous constitution that manifests physically during times of stress – he is repeatedly sick and becomes "deathly pale" when anxious.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Rowland is fundamentally a man torn between competing virtues. He is deeply devout and conscientious, with a strong religious sensibility that once led him to contemplate monastic life. Yet he also possesses "a quiet ambition" that distinguishes him from the truly contemplative Peter Meredith, making him suited for worldly success.</p>

<p>His defining trait is an intense nervous constitution. During the three days before his crucial interview at Hampton Court, "he had repeatedly been sick and looked so deathly pale" from anxiety. This physical manifestation of internal tension recurs throughout his story, particularly during the crisis over the Royal Supremacy oath.</p>

<p>He is a devoted family man, accepting the position at court largely for his wife and children's sake. Though he yearns at times for the religious life, he recognizes that his duty lies with his family. He is not ashamed of his humble brewing family, regularly visiting them at the Southwark brewery even after rising in status.</p>

<p>Intellectually, he is well-educated and thoughtful, shaped by books and the influence of the Meredith family. He studied at Oxford and the Inns of Court, becoming an accomplished lawyer. His religious views are conservative Catholic, opposing Protestant reform and trusting in "the wisdom and authority of the ages."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-and-education-c-1503-1530'>Early Life and Education (c. 1503-1530)</h3>

<p>Born around 1503, Rowland is the youngest son of Bull the brewer of Southwark. Unlike his brothers who followed their father into the prosperous family brewing business, Rowland's path is shaped by the new availability of printed books. The printer William Caxton had established his press at Westminster before Rowland's birth, flooding England with affordable books. Bull the brewer acquires several dozen volumes, and young Rowland buries his nose in Chaucer, Arthurian legends, and religious tracts.</p>

<p>This love of books leads him away from the brewery to become "a poor Oxford scholar" and then to study law at the Inns of Court. His reading and religious inclination cause him to contemplate entering the religious life, embracing the biblical teaching "better to marry than burn." Through <a href="characters/Peter-Meredith-1488.html">Peter Meredith</a>, he meets Susan Meredith, discovering "a happiness he had never dared to hope could be his."</p>

<h3 id='marriage-and-family-c-1524-1533'>Marriage and Family (c. 1524-1533)</h3>

<p>Rowland marries <a href="characters/Susan-Meredith-1505.html">Susan Meredith</a>, a match arranged by her brother Peter, who recognized their compatibility. Thomas Meredith complains that Peter and Rowland "even look the same," referring to their similar stout builds and balding heads. The marriage is deeply happy, both spiritually and physically. Susan notes approvingly that Rowland, unlike Peter, has the ambition she desires in a husband.</p>

<p>By August 1533, they have four children: a son Jonathan (then eight years old) and three fair-haired daughters. Jonathan closely resembles his father with his dark hair and intense features. The family is devout, and their own priest gives them "a little penance and a kindly absolution" for their marital intimacy with a smile they do not see.</p>

<h3 id='royal-service-at-hampton-court-august-1533'>Royal Service at Hampton Court (August 1533)</h3>

<p>In August 1533, <a href="characters/Thomas-Meredith-1507.html">Thomas Meredith</a> arranges an interview for Rowland with the Chancellor of England at Hampton Court. Despite his extreme nervousness, the interview succeeds beyond expectations. "We want you," the Chancellor tells him. For "Rowland Bull, son of modest Bull the brewer of Southwark," being needed "at the heart of the kingdom" is enormously flattering. The income is "more than he had dreamed."</p>

<p>Though he has doubts about the worldliness of the court, when he thinks of how this will "transform their lives," it seems "to be God's will." He walks through Hampton Court with Thomas that August afternoon, his "heart full of happiness," as everyone anticipates the birth of a male heir to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.</p>

<h3 id='life-at-chelsea-1533-1534'>Life at Chelsea (1533-1534)</h3>

<p>Rowland and Susan take "a little house in Chelsea" – charming, made of brick and oak beams with a tiled roof, two upper chambers, and a pleasant garden leading down to the Thames. Rowland works mainly at Westminster, bringing home only stories of kind treatment. The new income gives Susan "a sense of ease she had never known before."</p>

<p>Jonathan begins school at Westminster. Often Rowland takes him in the mornings, and Susan watches "as the two of them set off to walk down the lane together, hand in hand; or sometimes, if he rode, Rowland would put the boy in the saddle in front of him." These moments fill her with such happiness they bring "a lump to her throat."</p>

<p>The family maintains ties with both the Merediths and the Bulls. Thomas frequently visits, playing with the children who love him. Rowland continues to visit the old brewery at Southwark, unashamed of his brewing family despite his elevated status.</p>

<h3 id='the-crisis-of-conscience-1534'>The Crisis of Conscience (1534)</h3>

<p>The comfortable life shatters in 1534 when Parliament passes the Act of Supremacy, requiring all subjects to swear an oath accepting Henry VIII as Supreme Head of the Church. When three prominent men – Bishop Fisher, Sir Thomas More, and Doctor Wilson – refuse the oath and are sent to the Tower, Rowland faces his own crisis.</p>

<p>Thomas finds him "riding dejectedly," ashen pale. Rowland believes he should refuse the oath as well, following More's example. Susan, however, "thoroughly dislike[s]" More for his harsh persecution of heretics, and argues that the oath is acceptable. Thomas provides the legal argument: if king and Parliament together enact something, it has the voice "temporal and spiritual, of the whole realm," and even the Pope cannot deny it.</p>

<p>The evening before he must take the oath, Rowland's conscience troubles him greatly. His pallor shows his internal struggle, and he remarks sadly: "I wish Peter were here." The next morning, Thomas returns with reassuring news that the strict Carthusian monks at the Charterhouse have taken the oath. "If the Charterhouse, where Peter is going, can do it, so can you," Thomas says, and Rowland's face "relax[es] at last."</p>

<h3 id='arrest-and-imprisonment-1535'>Arrest and Imprisonment (1535)</h3>

<p>Despite taking the oath, Rowland cannot escape royal attention. His connections to the Charterhouse through Peter, and unfortunate chance encounters between Susan and the king, mark the family. In early 1535, King Henry's vindictive memory fixes on Rowland as a target.</p>

<p>When Secretary Cromwell comes to administer the oath directly, Rowland responds hesitantly: "Yes, as far as the Word of God allows." This qualified answer is insufficient. He is arrested and sent to the Tower, becoming one of many victims of Henry's determination to enforce absolute obedience.</p>

<p>In the Tower, Rowland is confined to a cell in the Bloody Tower. His nervous constitution torments him – he is sick again and his face shows that "some of yesterday's calm had worn off." Thomas visits regularly, and Peter Meredith comes despite his own dangerous position as a Charterhouse monk.</p>

<h3 id='escape-through-deception-may-1535'>Escape Through Deception (May 1535)</h3>

<p>As the Charterhouse monks face execution for refusing the Royal Supremacy, Peter Meredith and Thomas concoct an audacious plan. Peter visits Rowland in his cell and gives him wine laced with a sleeping draught. While Rowland sleeps, Peter switches clothes with him, placing himself in Rowland's position.</p>

<p>When Rowland awakens at dawn, he finds himself wearing a monk's habit in the Charterhouse. "Why was he wearing a monk's habit? He glanced round. Where was he?" Thomas explains the extraordinary sacrifice Peter has made. Peter dies in the Tower, allowing Rowland to escape.</p>

<p>The deception works because Peter and Rowland closely resemble each other – both with stout builds and balding heads. Thomas had complained about this similarity when Peter first introduced Rowland to Susan, never imagining it would later save his brother-in-law's life.</p>

<h3 id='life-in-rochester-1535-c-1543'>Life in Rochester (1535-c. 1543)</h3>

<p>Thomas arranges for Susan to move to Rochester with the children, finding her "a pleasant sanctuary in the old place, far from the unhappy scenes she associated with the capital." At mid-morning one day, there is a knock at the door, and "then she saw her husband."</p>

<p>Rowland lives out his remaining years in Rochester under the assumed name Robert Brown. "Few people in Rochester, in the years that followed, paid any special attention to the Brown family." He is known as a former monk who married the widow Susan Brown. He becomes a schoolmaster at Rochester's ancient school, seeming "happy in his work and in his loving family."</p>

<p>Yet there is a cost. Those who know him notice "a rather wistful expression which suggested that he might still secretly hanker after the life of the cloister he had left." The contemplative life he once considered before marriage remains part of his nature.</p>

<p>He dies around 1545, approximately ten years after coming to Rochester. Susan is so grief-stricken that the priest hears her call softly to him, "Rowland" – though the priest believes this was the name of her "first husband" and thinks little of it.</p>

<h3 id='family-legacy'>Family Legacy</h3>

<p>After Rowland's death, Susan is "determined to keep" the family "less conspicuous." The girls marry; Jonathan becomes a schoolmaster like his father. "Their inner faith, of course, was Catholic. But after all that had passed, she advised them: 'Whatever happens, keep your own counsel. Be silent.'"</p>

<p>Years later, Thomas Meredith sends his own infant son Edmund to Rochester "where I know you and Jonathan will look after him." Susan raises this nephew in her final years, finding him a "handsome little fellow with auburn hair and, she had to confess, great charm" – though she wonders "if he was not just a little too wild."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='susan-meredithsusan-meredith-1505html'><a href="characters/Susan-Meredith-1505.html">Susan Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Rowland's marriage to Susan is profoundly happy and mutually supportive. Peter Meredith brings them together, recognizing their compatibility. The marriage succeeds on multiple levels – spiritually, intellectually, and physically. Susan describes their physical relationship as "wanton," and their priest gives them gentle penances with a knowing smile.</p>

<p>Susan appreciates that Rowland has ambition while remaining devout – "I couldn't have married a man without ambition," she confesses. During his crisis of conscience, she fights fiercely for him, arguing that he should take the Royal Supremacy oath. When he is arrested despite this, she confronts Peter Meredith about saving him, showing a mother's determination to protect her family.</p>

<p>After his escape and assumed death, Susan lives as his widow, then secretly reunites with him in Rochester where they live as "Robert and Susan Brown." Her grief at his actual death is so profound that she unconsciously reveals his true name.</p>

<h3 id='peter-meredithpeter-meredith-1488html'><a href="characters/Peter-Meredith-1488.html">Peter Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Peter is Rowland's spiritual guide and the architect of his happiness. As Susan's brother and a devout priest, Peter recognizes in Rowland a kindred contemplative spirit and introduces him to Susan with the message: "This is the one."</p>

<p>The two men closely resemble each other physically – both stout and prematurely balding – which Thomas Meredith notes with some annoyance. This physical similarity proves providential, enabling Peter's ultimate sacrifice.</p>

<p>During Rowland's crisis over the Royal Supremacy oath, Rowland repeatedly wishes Peter were present for counsel. When Peter finally visits him in the Tower, Rowland relies on his guidance. Peter's decision to switch places with Rowland is the supreme act of love and sacrifice – giving his own life so that Rowland might live.</p>

<h3 id='thomas-merediththomas-meredith-1507html'><a href="characters/Thomas-Meredith-1507.html">Thomas Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Thomas is Rowland's worldly benefactor and brother-in-law. A charming courtier who "sang and danced well," Thomas secures Rowland's position with the Chancellor through his court connections. He embodies the practical, ambitious side of the Meredith family, in contrast to Peter's spiritual focus.</p>

<p>Thomas frequently visits the family at Chelsea, bringing wit, intelligence, and stories of court life. The children love him. When Rowland faces his crisis of conscience, Thomas provides the legal and political arguments for taking the oath, relieving Rowland's anxiety.</p>

<p>Despite being a secret Protestant, Thomas risks everything to help save Rowland through the deception at the Tower. He coordinates with Peter, manages the logistics of the escape, and arranges for the family's move to Rochester. His comment about Peter and Rowland looking alike – made in jest years earlier – becomes tragically prescient.</p>

<h3 id='jonathan-bull'>Jonathan Bull</h3>

<p>Rowland's relationship with his son Jonathan is particularly tender. The boy is "clearly an eight-year-old version of his father" with the same dark hair and pale, intense features. The morning walks to Westminster school – "hand in hand" or with Jonathan in the saddle before him – represent the peaceful happiness of Rowland's brief time of prosperity.</p>

<p>After the escape to Rochester, Jonathan grows up to become a schoolmaster like his father, perhaps influenced by Rowland's example as "Robert Brown," the schoolmaster of Rochester. Jonathan helps raise Thomas Meredith's son Edmund, continuing the family's tradition of education.</p>

<h3 id='bull-the-brewer-and-brothers'>Bull the Brewer and Brothers</h3>

<p>Rowland maintains affectionate ties with his brewing family despite his changed circumstances. His father and two brothers – who "remained true to the family type, with fair hair, blue eyes and broad Saxon faces" – are proud of Rowland's accomplishments. Thomas Meredith tells them cheerfully: "Such a fine scholar as Rowland can't fail to be chancellor one day."</p>

<p>The family gatherings at the George Inn in Southwark show Rowland's lack of shame about his origins. His brothers lack his intellectual gifts but are solidly conservative and supportive. This grounding in his humble family may contribute to his genuine modesty and devotion to simple domestic happiness.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Rowland Bull's life spans one of the most turbulent periods in English religious history – the break with Rome and the establishment of royal supremacy over the English Church. His story embodies the impossible position many devout, loyal Catholics found themselves in during the 1530s.</p>

<p>The Act of Supremacy (1534) required subjects to accept Henry VIII as "Supreme Head of the Church of England," effectively rejecting papal authority. For a conscientious Catholic lawyer like Rowland, this created an agonizing dilemma: obey the king's law or remain true to Rome. The refusal of Sir Thomas More – the former Chancellor and England's greatest Catholic intellectual – and Bishop John Fisher made the stakes clear. Both were eventually executed in 1535.</p>

<p>The persecution of the Charterhouse monks in 1535 represents one of the darkest chapters of Henry's reign. The Carthusians were England's most respected religious order, "above reproach" in their strict observance. When they refused the Royal Supremacy, Henry and Cromwell made brutal examples of them, executing them by the horrific medieval penalty for treason – hanged, drawn, and quartered. Peter Meredith dies as part of this martyrdom.</p>

<p>Rowland's story also illustrates the role of books in social mobility during the early Tudor period. William Caxton's introduction of printing to England in the 1470s democratized learning. For the first time, a brewer's son could own "several dozen books" and use them to escape his class through education. This represents a significant shift from medieval society.</p>

<p>His later life in Rochester under an assumed identity reflects the experience of many Catholics who chose survival through concealment during the Reformation. The policy Susan advises her family – "Whatever happens, keep your own counsel. Be silent" – became the strategy of recusant Catholic families for generations.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Rowland Bull embodies the tragedy of the Reformation's human cost. He is not a religious radical or political schemer, but a devout, educated family man trying to navigate an impossible situation. His story illustrates how Henry VIII's break with Rome destroyed lives that sought only modest prosperity and spiritual peace.</p>

<p>The contrast between ambition and contemplation runs throughout his character. Unlike Peter Meredith, Rowland possesses ambition – yet unlike Thomas Meredith, he is not worldly. He exists in the middle ground, wanting both success and spiritual authenticity. This makes him representative of many Tudor professionals caught between competing values.</p>

<p>The theme of sacrifice and substitution is central to his survival. Peter Meredith literally takes Rowland's place in the Tower, dying so that Rowland might live. This christological imagery – one dying for another – gives Rowland's survival a weight of debt and perhaps guilt. His "wistful expression" in Rochester may reflect not just yearning for the cloister, but awareness of the price Peter paid.</p>

<p>His assumed identity as "Robert Brown" explores themes of erasure and concealment. Rowland Bull, the ambitious lawyer who served the Chancellor, must die so that Robert Brown, the obscure schoolmaster, can live. His true name is only whispered once, by his grieving widow, then buried again. This represents the silencing of a generation of Catholics who chose survival over martyrdom.</p>

<p>The role of books in his life connects to broader themes of literacy, print culture, and social change. Books lead him from the brewery to the law, from one class to another. Yet they also lead him to dangerous questions about conscience and authority. The printed word both liberates and endangers him.</p>

<p>Finally, his story explores the nature of loyalty. He is loyal to his king, taking the oath when required. Yet he cannot give the unqualified assent Cromwell demands. His answer – "Yes, as far as the Word of God allows" – represents an attempt to maintain multiple loyalties that the absolutist Tudor state will not tolerate. His tragedy is that reasonable compromise becomes impossible.</p>
