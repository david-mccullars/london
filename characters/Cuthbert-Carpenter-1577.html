<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Cuthbert Carpenter was a London carpenter whose life embodied a profound internal conflict between his deep Puritan guilt and his passionate love for the theatre. A skilled craftsman, he became one of the builders of the Globe Theatre in 1599, working on what his strict religious upbringing taught him was an instrument of sin. His story represents the tension between London's emerging theatrical culture and the Puritan condemnation of the stage, ultimately resolved when family pressure forced him to abandon the playhouses he loved.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Cuthbert is described as squat in build. His grandmother, who was very small, only came up to his chest, suggesting he was relatively short but stocky. No other physical details are provided in the text.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Cuthbert was fundamentally torn between two incompatible passions: his love of theatre and his deeply ingrained religious fear of damnation. He was a conscientious worker—even his stern Puritan master acknowledged his skill as a carpenter—but his addiction to playgoing constantly put him at odds with his religious community and his own conscience.</p>

<p>His personality was marked by fear and guilt. He genuinely believed that attending playhouses risked hellfire, yet he could not stop himself from going. He had seen <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> ten times, and each viewing left him feeling "fear and shame." This guilt was so powerful that he would lie to his grandmother about his whereabouts, which only compounded his sense of sinfulness. He was capable of making fervent vows—"I will never, ever, go to the playhouse again"—yet breaking them repeatedly.</p>

<p>Despite his anxieties, Cuthbert was not entirely timid. When given the opportunity by <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a>, he found the courage to walk out on his domineering grandmother and participate in the daring midnight dismantling of the Theatre in Shoreditch—an act that filled him with both terror and exhilaration. Working on the Globe's construction, he was "happier than he had ever been in his life," even while believing he was building what his grandmother called "the Temple of Moloch."</p>

<p>Cuthbert was also a loyal friend and family member. He maintained contact with his sister Martha even after she was confined to caring for their grandmother, and when <a href="characters/John-Dogget-1570.html">John Dogget</a> was widowed with five children, Cuthbert thoughtfully arranged for Martha to meet the family, recognizing it as both a practical solution and a Christian duty.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-before-1597'>Early Life (before 1597)</h3>

<p>Cuthbert's parents died when he was young, leaving him and his siblings in the care of their strict grandmother, "a tiny woman in the black dress" who ruled the family "with an iron rod." Both he and his brother were apprenticed to strict masters, while two of his sisters were "firmly married off at fifteen" and the third, Martha, was told she must stay home and keep house. Cuthbert was apprenticed as a carpenter and became a journeyman by age twenty.</p>

<h3 id='1597-the-theatre-goers-guilt'>1597: The Theatre-Goer's Guilt</h3>

<p>By 1597, though a twenty-year-old journeyman carpenter, Cuthbert still lived in his grandmother's house and contributed rent. His grandmother maintained strict moral supervision, even reporting his failings to his master. His secret vice was the playhouse: he would sneak away whenever possible, had seen <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> ten times, and felt crushing guilt each time. His grandmother declared that "Those who touch the whore or attend the playhouse will suffer on Judgment Day," and Cuthbert believed her completely. He had never touched a prostitute, but the playhouse was his recurring sin.</p>

<p>When his grandmother confronted him after he attended a play, asking if he had been to the playhouse, he replied, "I have not been to a play"—technically true in that moment, but deliberately misleading. This lie deepened his shame.</p>

<h3 id='1598-liberation-and-the-theatre-heist'>1598: Liberation and the Theatre Heist</h3>

<p>Cuthbert's fortunes changed dramatically through his friendship with Edmund Meredith. When Cuthbert's Puritan master began finding fault with his work after being told by the grandmother about his theatre-going, Edmund both found him a new master and, crucially, gave him "the courage to do something even more daring: to walk out on his grandmother."</p>

<p>In December 1598, Cuthbert participated in the secret midnight dismantling of the Theatre in Shoreditch. Gathered in <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a>'s house with other conspirators, he was fed meat pies and hot toddy and sat "jammed between a fellow carpenter and a pile of sweaty costumes from <em>Twelfth Night</em>," hardly able to stop grinning. This was "the most exciting thing he had ever done in his life."</p>

<p>Despite his excitement, his old fears surfaced. As they approached the dark, empty Theatre, Cuthbert's imagination conjured terrifying visions: that it might be a trap set by London's aldermen, or worse, that "the floor of the building would suddenly open to reveal a glowing tunnel down to the pit of hell itself." Yet he mastered his fear and worked through the night.</p>

<p>The dismantling took several days. Cuthbert kept a small bonfire burning in the pit so workers on night watch could warm themselves. By New Year's Day 1599, the Theatre at Shoreditch had been completely taken down.</p>

<h3 id='1599-building-the-globe'>1599: Building the Globe</h3>

<p>Cuthbert worked on constructing the new Globe Theatre on Bankside in Southwark. Despite knowing "what his grandmother thought"—that Bankside was "Sodom and Gomorrah" and the playhouse "the Temple of Moloch"—he reasoned with fatalistic Calvinist logic: "if, as his grandmother believed, God had already predestined him for hellfire, then there was nothing he could do about it anyway." He "worked on the Temple of Moloch with a will, and was happier than he had ever been in his life."</p>

<p>He took particular delight in the Globe's theatrical machinery, especially "the special pulley and harness that would be used when one of the actors needed to fly over the stage." When visiting his grandmother and she asked where he had been, he would confuse her by declaring: "I was in the Lords' Room today. And I think, grandmother, that I saw the Heavens as well"—referring to the minstrels' gallery and the painted ceiling of the stage canopy, but framed to sound like a spiritual experience.</p>

<p>In the spring, he rode in the procession that carried the Globe's props and costumes across London Bridge from the city to Southwark, perched atop a cart full of theatrical properties including thrones, dragons, and a hell-mouth.</p>

<h3 id='c-1604-1606-marriage-and-family'>c. 1604-1606: Marriage and Family</h3>

<p>Cuthbert married "a sensible girl, not ungodly," and settled in lodgings in the next street from his grandmother. They had a daughter, and then around 1606, a son. When the son was born, Cuthbert and his wife asked Martha to choose his name. She chose Gideon, "for he was a warrior for the Lord." The family grew larger over the years, their lodgings becoming increasingly cramped.</p>

<h3 id='1611-the-oath'>1611: The Oath</h3>

<p>Around 1611, Cuthbert's grandmother died, leaving her house to Martha. When Cuthbert and his wife asked if they might share the larger space—their own lodgings being "small, his family getting larger every year"—Martha set a condition. She presented him with a Bible and insisted: "I cannot have Cuthbert in grandmother's house if he frequents the playhouse too."</p>

<p>After years of Martha's patient prayers to save his soul, Cuthbert faced a stark choice between his family's needs and his beloved theatre. "Poor Cuthbert thought of his family" and took the Bible and swore. Martha believed she was "helping you to break an evil spell." Cuthbert went on his way "sorrowing, but saved."</p>

<h3 id='1613-the-globe-burns'>1613: The Globe Burns</h3>

<p>In June 1613, the Globe Theatre burned to the ground during a performance of <em>Henry VIII</em> when cannon fire from the stage sent sparks into the thatched roof. Cuthbert, "who had kept his word and not seen a play in two years, looked sad; but, seeing this was clearly a judgment from God, Martha felt a lightening of the heart."</p>

<p>That same year, Cuthbert helped arrange a marriage between Martha and his friend John Dogget, who had suddenly lost his wife and was overwhelmed caring for five young children. "He needs a wife," Cuthbert told her; "a Christian woman to look after those children." When Martha hesitated about the move to Southwark, he urged her: "You could save them. It would be a Christian duty." His thoughtfulness in considering both his friend's need and his sister's capacity for good moved Martha to agree.</p>

<h3 id='1620-1621-death'>1620-1621: Death</h3>

<p>In 1620, Dogget and Martha attempted to sail to America with the Pilgrim Fathers but abandoned the voyage at Plymouth and returned to London in September. Shortly after their return—around 1620 or early 1621—Cuthbert suddenly died. His son Gideon then suggested going into business with Dogget, and together they set up a repair shop just by the top of Garlic Hill.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='grandmother'>Grandmother</h3>

<p>Cuthbert's unnamed grandmother was the dominant force in his early life. After his parents' death, this "tiny woman in the black dress" ruled the family with absolute authority. Though he was twenty and physically much larger—she only came up to his chest—Cuthbert remained "afraid of her." She controlled whom his sisters married, reported his failings to his master, and constantly watched over his morals. Her rigid Puritanism equated playgoing with damnation, declaring that those who "attend the playhouse will suffer on Judgment Day."</p>

<p>Despite his fear and her tyranny, Cuthbert maintained his connection to her, visiting weekly even after he walked out. Her worldview shaped his consciousness so deeply that even when building the Globe—the happiest time of his life—he experienced it through the lens of her condemnation, believing he was constructing "the Temple of Moloch."</p>

<h3 id='martha-carpenter'>Martha Carpenter</h3>

<p>Martha was Cuthbert's younger sister, the one their grandmother designated to stay home and keep house rather than marry. Despite Martha's strict Puritanism—inherited from their grandmother—Cuthbert maintained a loving relationship with her. She never gave up hope for his soul, continuing to pray for him and visit even after he left to work on the Globe, which their grandmother had cursed.</p>

<p>The relationship was one of genuine mutual care. When Cuthbert's son was born, he honored Martha by asking her to name the child. Years later, facing the choice between theatre and family housing, he accepted Martha's condition that he abandon the playhouse, taking an oath on the Bible she offered. Though the choice pained him, he submitted to save his family.</p>

<p>In return, Cuthbert looked out for Martha's welfare. When John Dogget was widowed, Cuthbert thoughtfully arranged for them to meet, recognizing that Dogget needed a wife and Martha could find purpose in caring for the children. It was an act of Christian charity that also showed his sister a path beyond their grandmother's house.</p>

<h3 id='edmund-meredith'>Edmund Meredith</h3>

<p>Edmund Meredith was Cuthbert's liberator and patron. When Cuthbert's Puritan master began finding fault with his work due to reports of his theatre attendance, Edmund found him a new master. More significantly, Edmund gave Cuthbert "the courage" to walk out on his domineering grandmother—a decisive break that changed his life.</p>

<p>Edmund recruited Cuthbert for the daring dismantling of the Theatre and presumably arranged for his employment building the Globe. This friendship opened the happiest period of Cuthbert's life, though it also plunged him deeper into the very activities his religious upbringing condemned. The text suggests Cuthbert remained grateful to Edmund, calling the enterprise "all thanks to Meredith."</p>

<h3 id='john-dogget'>John Dogget</h3>

<p>Cuthbert and John Dogget were friends, both connected to the theatre world. When Dogget was suddenly widowed in 1613 with five children in his care, Cuthbert recognized both his friend's desperate need and his sister Martha's capacity to help. His thoughtful matchmaking served both parties: Dogget gained "a Christian woman to look after those children," and Martha found purpose beyond her grandmother's house. After Cuthbert's death around 1620-1621, Dogget partnered with Cuthbert's son Gideon in business, suggesting the friendship had created lasting family ties.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Cuthbert lived during a pivotal era in English theatre history, the final years of Elizabeth I's reign and the beginning of James I's. The 1590s saw the height of the English Renaissance stage, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Shakespeare</a> at his creative peak and London's playhouses drawing enormous crowds. Yet this theatrical flowering occurred against fierce Puritan opposition.</p>

<p>The conflict Cuthbert embodied was a genuine cultural divide in Elizabethan and Jacobean London. Puritans viewed theatres as sources of immorality, idleness, and spiritual danger. Playhouses were relegated to liberties like Southwark and Shoreditch—outside direct City control—precisely because London's aldermen, many of them Puritan, wanted them banned entirely. The Puritans would eventually succeed: in 1642, Parliament closed all theatres, and they remained closed until the Restoration in 1660.</p>

<p>Cuthbert participated in one of theatre history's most dramatic moments: the December 1598 dismantling of the Theatre in Shoreditch. This building, constructed in 1576, was England's first purpose-built playhouse. When the lease dispute with landowner Giles Allen threatened the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuthbert_Burbage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burbage brothers</a>, they exploited a legal provision allowing them to dismantle the structure. The Theatre's timbers were transported across the Thames and rebuilt as the Globe in 1599.</p>

<p>The Globe became the most famous playhouse in English history, premiering many of Shakespeare's greatest works including <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>King Lear</em>, and <em>Macbeth</em>. Cuthbert's work as a builder literally constructed the stage for the greatest flourishing of English drama. His pride in mechanisms like the flying harness and the "Heavens"—the painted ceiling over the stage—reflects the technical sophistication of Elizabethan theatre.</p>

<p>The fire that destroyed the Globe in 1613 during a performance of <em>Henry VIII</em> was seen by Puritans like Martha as divine judgment. That the theatre would burn just two years after Cuthbert had sworn off playgoing must have seemed, to his sister, a clear vindication of their grandmother's warnings. The Globe was rebuilt with a tile roof, but Cuthbert, bound by his oath, never saw another play there.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Cuthbert Carpenter represents the collision between Renaissance humanism and Puritan fundamentalism in Elizabethan England. His story illustrates how ordinary Londoners experienced the cultural warfare between the city's flourishing artistic culture and the religious movement that sought to suppress it as ungodly.</p>

<p>His internal conflict—genuine terror of damnation coexisting with irrepressible love of theatre—shows the psychological toll of this cultural divide. Unlike characters who choose one side or the other, Cuthbert tried to inhabit both worlds, and the strain is palpable. He experiences the Globe's construction as simultaneously the happiest time of his life and his descent into sin. This is not hypocrisy but genuine divided consciousness.</p>

<p>The novel uses Cuthbert's story to show how Puritan doctrine operated through family structures and social pressure. His grandmother's tyranny, Martha's patient spiritual manipulation, and the threat to his professional reputation through his master all worked together to enforce religious conformity. When Cuthbert finally submits, it is not through intellectual conviction but through the practical necessity of housing his growing family—a victory for social pressure over personal desire.</p>

<p>Yet the text treats Cuthbert with sympathy. His love for <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, his joy in theatrical machinery, his happiness working on the Globe—these are presented as natural and human, not sinful. The narrative perspective suggests that the tragedy is not Cuthbert's playgoing but the religious culture that made him suffer for it. His sorrowful oath-taking represents the closing of something beautiful in his life.</p>

<p>Cuthbert also embodies the artisan class's contribution to cultural achievement. He was not a playwright, actor, or patron, but a skilled carpenter whose labor literally built the Globe. The novel honors such practical contributions: without workers like Cuthbert, Shakespeare would have had no stage. His participation in the midnight dismantling shows working men taking dramatic risks for a cultural institution they valued, even at potential cost to their livelihoods and reputations.</p>

<p>Finally, through Cuthbert's ultimate capitulation, the novel foreshadows the Puritan triumph. When he swears off the theatre in 1611, it prefigures Parliament's closure of all playhouses in 1642. His sister Martha, gentle but implacable in her conviction that theatre is evil, represents the force that would eventually succeed in silencing the stage for eighteen years. Cuthbert's sorrow at taking the oath is London theatre's sorrow at its coming suppression.</p>
