<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Sam Dogget is one of twin seven-year-old boys raised in the rough neighborhood of Seven Dials, who through an extraordinary twist of fate is (incorrectly) revealed to be the legitimate heir to the Earl of St James. A cheerful, bold street urchin and petty thief, Sam's life transforms dramatically when he is caught stealing a shilling while working as a chimney sweep's assistant in Hanover Square, leading to his recognition by his biological mother and restoration to his aristocratic birthright.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Sam is described as having a shock of white hair with a curious white patch or streak, and webbed fingers - distinctive hereditary traits passed down through the Dogget family line. At age seven, he appears as a typical street urchin: barefoot, blackened with soot from chimney sweeping, and smoking a long pipe (common for children in Georgian London). His face and features are nearly identical to his twin brother Sep, making them very alike in appearance despite not being identical twins.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Sam is characterized as "the jollier of the two" brothers, always ready to joke and possessing a bold, confident nature. He demonstrates remarkable cunning for his age, having developed an elaborate criminal scheme involving linkboys at Covent Garden theatre where he would lead gentlemen into ambushes and collect rewards from the robbers afterward. He shows a cynical understanding of the world despite his youth, confidently declaring that "The Runners won't trouble with me" and "they couldn't prove nothing."</p>

<p>Unlike his more cautious brother Sep, Sam is untroubled by moral qualms about stealing. He views theft pragmatically, particularly when stealing from his gin-addicted mother, which he considers merely claiming "their rightful share of the family's money." His ambition is clear and practical: he wants to become a costermonger like his father Harry, and since his elder brother will inherit the family barrow, Sam systematically saves money to buy his own.</p>

<p>Sam displays considerable resourcefulness and entrepreneurial spirit. He develops the chimney sweep scheme specifically to gain access to wealthy Mayfair houses, understanding that sweep's assistants often receive tips and can move through grand homes with relative freedom. He carefully instructs Sep on the art of theft: "Don't take anything too valuable or they'll see it's gone. Just something small they won't even miss."</p>

<p>When caught stealing, Sam proves himself an accomplished actor, capable of feigning terror and tears convincingly. However, when confronted and held by Captain Meredith in Hanover Square, he shows genuine spirit, making a desperate escape attempt despite the pain. Later, when adapting to aristocratic life, he demonstrates pragmatism and flexibility, accepting his father Harry's advice to embrace his good fortune, though he admits "It don't feel right."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-childhood-c-1742-1750'>Early Childhood (c. 1742-1750)</h3>

<p>Sam was born around 1742, the biological son of Lord and Lady St James. However, his mother, driven by a complex revenge plot and perhaps disturbed by his physical deformities (webbed fingers), arranged for him to be switched with another child who subsequently died. The infant Sam was abandoned near Seven Dials, where he was found by <a href="characters/Harry-Dogget-1710.html">Harry Dogget</a>, a costermonger, approximately one week after Harry's legitimate son had been born.</p>

<p>Harry discovered the baby in the muddy street by Seven Dials and was struck by the child's distinctive features - a tiny white streak of hair and webbed hands, exactly like his own newborn son. Despite suspecting the child might actually be his own from an affair, Harry took the baby home. His wife, with characteristic good humor and no questions asked, declared "I must've had twins, Harry. Just never noticed," and from that moment Sam was raised as the twin brother of the baby who would be named Sep.</p>

<p>Sam grew up in a courtyard tenement near Seven Dials, in a large family with multiple siblings. His childhood was typical of the London poor: barefoot, smoking pipes, eating cheap oysters, and learning early to "look sharp" and "look after themselves" as their father Harry constantly warned. The family struggled financially, largely because Mrs Dogget spent much of Harry's earnings on gin from the notorious "Gin Lane" area.</p>

<h3 id='working-life-1749-1750'>Working Life (1749-1750)</h3>

<p>By age seven, Sam and Sep worked together as a team, picking up odd jobs and running errands to earn money, which they carefully hid from their mother to prevent her from spending it on gin. Sam viewed this as justified: "Better us than Needle and Pin" (rhyming slang for gin). While Sep was "inclined to be more serious," Sam branched out into more audacious criminal activity.</p>

<p>Sam developed a sophisticated scheme working as a linkboy near Covent Garden theatre. He would offer to light the way for gentlemen leaving the theatre, then lead them into ambushes near Seven Dials where confederates would rob them. Sam would convincingly play the terrified victim, crying and showing fear, then collect his share of the proceeds the next morning. The scheme showed both his cunning and his talent for performance.</p>

<p>In May 1750, Sam conceived a new plan while watching the May Day chimney-sweeps' procession in Grosvenor Square. Recognizing that sweep's assistants gained access to grand houses and often received tips from sympathetic servants or householders, he saw both a legitimate income opportunity and a chance for theft. He and Sep partnered with a simple-minded sweep, working in tandem to cover two houses at once, playing on sympathy to maximize tips. Sam also recognized the opportunity to steal small, easily missed items - "a silver coin here and there, an ivory comb, a gold button."</p>

<p>After two weeks of Sam's complaints, Sep reluctantly agreed to participate in the theft scheme. Sam decided they would target the grand houses in Hanover Square, the most aristocratic address in the area.</p>

<h3 id='discovery-and-transformation-may-1750'>Discovery and Transformation (May 1750)</h3>

<p>Sam's fate changed dramatically when he was caught stealing a shilling from the kitchen table at number seventeen, Hanover Square - the residence of Lady St James. Captain <a href="characters/Jack-Meredith-1722.html">Jack Meredith</a>, who had just married Lady St James in a hasty ceremony following her husband's death in a duel, caught the soot-blackened boy by the ear and threatened to call the Bow Street Runners.</p>

<p>Sam initially denied the theft with practiced conviction ("I never stole nothing... Never before, sir. I promise"), demonstrating his skill at deception. When questioned, he refused to reveal who had ordered him to steal, showing loyalty to his criminal associates. He made a desperate escape attempt, wrenching his ear painfully to break free, but was caught again by Meredith's long reach.</p>

<p>It was then that Meredith noticed the boy's unusual features: both hands were webbed, and his hair, once the soot had fallen out, had a "curious white patch in it." When Lady St James saw these distinctive features, she stood "transfixed, white as though she had seen a ghost" and could only say "Oh, my God. It cannot... surely... oh, dear God." She recognized her abandoned son.</p>

<p>Sam escaped in the confusion but was tracked down the next day by Meredith in Grosvenor Square. Meredith, having learned the truth from his wife during the night and determined to right the wrong, took Sam to find his adoptive father. They encountered <a href="characters/Harry-Dogget-1710.html">Harry Dogget</a> at his barrow in Covent Garden, where Harry initially denied the boy was anything but his own son, showing protective loyalty.</p>

<p>When Meredith explained that Sam was "undoubtedly the missing child" and would live at the grand house in Hanover Square "not a servant, like, but one o' the family," Harry whistled in wonderment. He secured permission to visit the next day to ensure Sam was "all right."</p>

<h3 id='final-conversation-with-harry'>Final Conversation with Harry</h3>

<p>The following day, at the corner of Hanover Square, Sam had a revealing conversation with Harry while Lady St James's wedding party was in progress. Sam confessed his confusion about the situation, having heard from his drunken mother a year earlier that Harry had found Sep by Seven Dials. "Well, if it was him you found and not me, then what'm I doing here?" he asked.</p>

<p>Harry's response demonstrated both wisdom and pragmatic philosophy: "Fate. See, it was you that went into the house and tried to steal a shilling, right? So it was you they found." When Sam worried that "It don't feel right," Harry was firm: "Use your loaf. You want to live all your life in the bread and butter? Look at this 'ouse. 'Er ladyship says you're 'er Bath bun. You'd better keep quiet and be glad of it. Don't you want to be a lord?"</p>

<p>Sam pragmatically admitted the advantages: "It ain't so bad. You should see the food. Not a bleeding oyster in sight." Harry gave him final advice - "Have a good life. If you get in trouble you know where to find me, but if you give this lot up I'll take a strap to your backside till you'll wish you was a lord again" - and Sam requested his father "Tell Sep he can have all my savings" before Harry departed, "whistling a merry tune."</p>

<h3 id='life-as-earl-of-st-james-1750-onwards'>Life as Earl of St James (1750 onwards)</h3>

<p>Sam was thus restored to his birthright as George, Lord Bocton, heir to the Earl of St James title. His mother insisted he spend at least a year in seclusion with a tutor before being presented to society, as "the urchin... could scarcely speak in any language fit to hear, let alone read and write."</p>

<p>When Lady St James (now Mrs. Meredith) died in childbirth the following year (c. 1751), Sam came under the guardianship of <a href="characters/Jack-Meredith-1722.html">Jack Meredith</a>, who "carried out fully and faithfully" his obligation, "taking only a perfectly proper fee from the estate for his trouble." The narrator notes that "The young earl was very fond of him."</p>

<p>The text's final comment on Sam observes that "those who remembered the old earl... would remark that the son was a much more amusing fellow than his father" - suggesting that Sam's street origins and cheerful personality left a lasting mark on his aristocratic character.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='sep-dogget'>Sep Dogget</h3>

<p>Sam's relationship with <a href="characters/Sep-Dogget-1742.html">Sep</a> is that of brothers and partners, though with contrasting personalities. While they work together closely and share a "faint smile of complicity" when stealing from their mother, Sam is the leader and instigator. He constantly tries to overcome Sep's moral reluctance about stealing from the wealthy houses, finally convincing him after "two weeks of listening to Sam's complaints." Sam's patience with Sep shows both his persuasive nature and his genuine bond with his twin. His final gesture - asking Harry to tell Sep "he can have all my savings" - demonstrates real affection and a desire to share his good fortune with his brother. The dramatic irony is that Sep was actually the biological Lord Bocton while Sam was Harry's biological son, but because Sam was the one caught stealing, he became the earl while Sep remained a commoner.</p>

<h3 id='harry-dogget'>Harry Dogget</h3>

<p>Sam's relationship with his adoptive father Harry is warm and characterized by mutual understanding. Harry's philosophy of self-reliance - "You must look sharp now, and learn to look after yourselves" - clearly influenced Sam's entrepreneurial criminal activities. Sam respects Harry's wisdom and accepts his final advice about embracing his aristocratic fate. Harry shows genuine protective loyalty when Meredith first approaches, initially denying Sam could have been found rather than born to him. Their final conversation reveals both men's pragmatic worldview and their comfortable, honest relationship. Sam continues to call him "Dad" even after learning the truth about his origins, and Harry's whistling departure suggests his genuine pleasure at Sam's good fortune despite losing his son.</p>

<h3 id='lady-st-james'>Lady St James</h3>

<p>Sam's relationship with his biological mother is brief and traumatic. Having been abandoned by her as an infant because of his physical deformities and her revenge schemes, Sam only encounters her when caught stealing in her house. Her reaction to seeing him - shock, horror, and eventual maternal anguish - comes too late to mean much to the seven-year-old urchin who knows Harry as his real father. The text suggests she tries to compensate by insisting on personally overseeing his education and keeping him secluded for a year, but she dies in childbirth the following year, leaving Sam under Meredith's guardianship. There is no indication that Sam ever developed genuine affection for her.</p>

<h3 id='captain-jack-meredith'>Captain Jack Meredith</h3>

<p>Sam's relationship with his stepfather/guardian develops from adversarial to protective. Meredith begins as the threatening adult who catches Sam stealing and holds him by the ear, yet shows a playful side, enjoying watching the sooty boy disturb his wife's pristine chamber. Meredith's moral character emerges when he insists on finding and restoring Sam despite Lady St James's wishes: "I've killed the father. But I'm damned if I'll disinherit the child." Meredith proves to be a faithful guardian after Lady St James's death, and the text notes "The young earl was very fond of him," suggesting Sam recognized and appreciated Meredith's integrity.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Sam's story unfolds in 1750, during the height of Georgian London's social contrasts. The chapter "Gin Lane" takes its name from the notorious gin epidemic that ravaged the London poor in the mid-18th century, and Sam's mother Mrs. Dogget is a victim of this crisis. The cheap availability of gin ("Needle and Pin" in rhyming slang) destroyed working-class families throughout London, particularly in areas like Seven Dials.</p>

<p>Seven Dials, where Sam was raised, was one of London's most notorious slums - a place where "if you wanted to find the cheapest gin, you came to Seven Dials... If you wanted female company... go down to the clock... And if, by chance, you wanted your pockets picked, why you could walk down any one of the seven streets and someone would be sure to oblige you." Yet the text emphasizes it was also a community where "everybody knew them" and neighbors looked out for each other's children.</p>

<p>The Bow Street Runners, mentioned when Sep warns Sam "The Bow Street Runners will get you," were established "just the previous year" (1749) by Henry Fielding, the novelist and magistrate, representing London's first attempt at a proper police force. This historical detail situates Sam's criminal activities at the very moment when law enforcement was beginning to modernize.</p>

<p>The chimney sweeps, central to Sam's scheme, were a product of the building boom in Georgian London. The construction of "all the fine new houses" in developments like Hanover Square and Grosvenor Square created demand for sweeps, whose young assistants - "some as young as five or six" - were sent up chimneys that long-handled brushes couldn't reach. These children, often orphans or "sent out to work by their poor family," might be treated harshly or might receive sympathy and tips from households. Sam's recognition of this as both a legitimate income source and a theft opportunity shows the resourcefulness poverty demanded.</p>

<p>The Foundling Hospital in Coram Fields, mentioned in the chapter, represented Georgian London's emerging philanthropy. Established by Captain Coram and supported by Handel's fundraising concerts, it cared for abandoned children - children like Sam might have been, had Harry Dogget not found and raised him. The ironic contrast is clear: while charitable institutions were being established for abandoned children, the aristocratic Lady St James had deliberately abandoned her own son to the streets.</p>

<p>The Fleet Marriage, by which Lady St James and Meredith wed hastily in the Clink prison, was a notorious Georgian institution where clergymen imprisoned for debt would perform marriages with "no banns read, no questions asked" for a fee. This "strange little side-show to the Church of England, carried out not half a mile from the Bishop of London's great cathedral, had been going on quite unhindered by the Church authorities for several generations."</p>

<p>Sam's story embodies the extreme social mobility - both upward and downward - possible in 18th-century London. He moves from barefoot street urchin to Earl in a single day, while his twin Sep, who was actually born to the aristocracy, remains a working-class fireman, "happy" and never realizing "he was owed a legacy."</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Sam Dogget's story powerfully illustrates several central themes in Rutherford's <i>London</i>.</p>

<p><strong>Identity and Nature versus Nurture</strong>: Sam's transformation from street urchin to aristocrat raises questions about identity and class. Though born an aristocrat, Sam is shaped entirely by his working-class upbringing. The narrator's observation that the young Earl was "a much more amusing fellow than his father" suggests his Seven Dials origins permanently marked his personality - his cheerfulness, humor, and boldness remain even after he assumes his title. The text implies that authentic identity is formed by experience rather than birth.</p>

<p><strong>The Arbitrariness of Fate</strong>: The story's central irony - that Sam and Sep were switched at birth, with each taking the other's rightful place - emphasizes fate's capricious nature. Harry Dogget's explanation to Sam encapsulates this theme: "Fate... it was you that went into the house and tried to steal a shilling, right? So it was you they found." Sam's decision to steal that particular shilling in that particular house at that particular moment determined his entire future. The text suggests that life's outcomes often depend on random chance rather than merit or justice.</p>

<p><strong>Class and Social Mobility</strong>: Sam's story demonstrates both the rigid barriers and surprising permeability of Georgian class structure. While vast gulfs separate Seven Dials from Hanover Square - symbolized by Sam having to wear shoes in summer and learn to speak "in any language fit to hear" - movement between these worlds proves possible through extraordinary circumstances. The story neither romanticizes poverty (Sam's family eats oysters constantly because they're the cheapest food, and his mother is destroyed by gin) nor wholly condemns aristocracy (Meredith proves honorable, insisting on restoring Sam's birthright).</p>

<p><strong>Family and Belonging</strong>: The story challenges conventional definitions of family. Harry Dogget, though not Sam's biological father, proves to be his true parent through love, protection, and wisdom. Harry's parting words - offering continued support while encouraging Sam to embrace his opportunity - demonstrate genuine paternal love. Meanwhile, Lady St James's biological connection to Sam means nothing, as she abandoned him in infancy and only reclaimed him through compulsion. The text suggests that family is made through relationship rather than blood.</p>

<p><strong>Crime and Morality</strong>: Sam's criminal activities are presented without moral condemnation. His theft from his mother is framed as justifiable self-preservation - "Better us than Needle and Pin." His linkboy robberies show entrepreneurial intelligence. Even his stealing from wealthy houses is treated as resourceful survival in an unjust social system. The text's sympathies lie with the poor child trying to establish himself rather than with his wealthy victims, reflecting a broader critique of Georgian social inequality.</p>

<p><strong>Lost and Found Children</strong>: Sam's story connects to the motif of lost, abandoned, or switched children that appears throughout the book, reflecting London's long history of orphans, foundlings, and uncertain parentage. The Foundling Hospital, prominently featured in the chapter, institutionalized care for abandoned children, yet Sam's story shows how easily a child could slip through any safety net, surviving only through the kindness of a stranger like Harry Dogget.</p>

<p><strong>Heredity</strong>: The distinctive physical traits - webbed fingers and white hair - that run through the Dogget family serve as markers of lineage and enable Sam's recognition. Yet the text emphasizes the irony that these supposedly hereditary markers are unreliable indicators of true parentage. Sep has them despite being the biological son of Lord St James, while Sam has them because of his Dogget blood. The physical markers that should clarify identity actually complicate it.</p>
