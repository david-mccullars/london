<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Cartimandua is the wife of <a href="characters/The-Fisher-80BC.html">The Fisher</a> and mother of three children, living in a hamlet on the southern bank of the Thames opposite Londinos in 54 BC. Driven by passionate love for her husband and fear of losing him in the coming Roman invasion, she makes a terrible secret bargain with a Celtic nobleman to secure her family's safety – agreeing to give away her young daughter <a href="characters/Branwen-60BC.html">Branwen</a> in exchange for her husband's exemption from battle. When her plan fails due to her husband's sacred oath to fight alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassivellaunus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassivelaunus</a>, she experiences the devastating consequences of her desperate choice.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Cartimandua is described as a striking woman with thick, raven-dark hair that falls past her shoulders. She has a slim, tall body with heavy breasts, pale face with narrow cheekbones, and seductive eyes. When she moves, there is a small, sinuous quality to her body. The dark-bearded nobleman observes that in future years her face will likely become haggard and her eyes sunken, with her passion perhaps turning to obsession or bitterness, but at the time of the story she is still attractive, with several good years remaining.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Cartimandua is defined by an overwhelming, consuming passion for her husband that dominates her every action and thought. This passion is described as "a fearsome thing" – sometimes beautiful, often like an unrelenting ache, and sometimes "blank and terrible, gripping and then hurling her forwards so that she was helpless." She desires him, wants to protect him, and finds it hard to imagine existence without him. This intense love drives her to rationalize harsh, morally questionable decisions.</p>

<p>She is deeply fearful of being widowed in a world where women already outnumber men, knowing her chances of finding another husband would be poor if her current husband dies in battle. This fear, combined with her desire for more children and concern for her existing family's survival, leads her to desperate measures.</p>

<p>Cartimandua exhibits wild mood swings and erratic behavior, especially after making her secret bargain. She is described as mercurial, prone to scolding her children for no reason, bursting into tears, and watching her husband with pale-faced, almost angry intensity. She becomes anxiously overprotective, particularly of Branwen – rushing to the children if they cry or disappear, clutching them tightly, and then just as quickly sending them away.</p>

<p>The nobleman who makes the deal with her perceives her as "like an animal from the wild, only half tame" – a troubled spirit whose seductive movements may be calculated or simply her natural way. She is capable of deceiving her husband and rationalizing the trade of her daughter's freedom, telling herself repeatedly that it's "all for the best" and that Branwen might have better opportunities as the nobleman's property than in their dull village. Yet she is also tormented by terrible guilt and anguish, the agony of which haunts her throughout the spring "like a haunting and reproachful echo."</p>

<p>When crisis strikes – particularly when Branwen goes missing in the woods – Cartimandua's fear becomes physical and overwhelming. She goes deathly pale, her jaw drops in horror, and she races through the woods driven by the knowledge that "if the girl was lost, then all was lost."</p>

<p>Despite her moral compromises, she genuinely loves her children. The old druid with his second sight perceives her "terrible dilemma," suggesting that her situation is not simply one of selfishness but of a woman caught in impossible circumstances trying to protect those she loves through morally questionable means.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='spring-54-bc-the-secret-bargain'>Spring 54 BC: The Secret Bargain</h3>

<p>When news arrives that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julius Caesar</a> is preparing to invade Britain with five legions and two thousand cavalry, fear grips the Celtic communities along the Thames. Cartimandua, terrified of losing her husband in the coming conflict, makes a secret arrangement with a dark-bearded Celtic nobleman who is organizing the defenses for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassivellaunus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassivelaunus</a>.</p>

<p>The nobleman visits the hamlet twice in the month before the invasion. Cartimandua approaches him during his second visit, just after the druids' ceremony offering a ceremonial shield to the river. They confirm their agreement: in exchange for ensuring her husband does not have to fight, she will give the nobleman her young daughter Branwen. The girl will technically become his slave, though Cartimandua rationalizes that such children often learn skills and make good marriages. Her husband must know nothing of the arrangement.</p>

<p>The noble observes her with calculating eyes, noting her sexual appeal and predicting her eventual decline, but agrees to honor the bargain. As he rides away, Cartimandua returns to her innocent children, wondering if they will still love her when they learn what she has done.</p>

<h3 id='spring-summer-54-bc-living-with-guilt'>Spring-Summer 54 BC: Living with Guilt</h3>

<p>For months Cartimandua lives with her terrible secret, watching and waiting. The old druid, who has the gift of second sight, perceives her "terrible dilemma" though she tells him nothing. His momentary gaze at the ceremony is enough to make her tremble with fear that her secret has been discovered.</p>

<p>Her behavior becomes increasingly erratic. She scolds Segovax and Branwen for no reason, then suddenly seizes and clutches them tightly before sending them away again. Once, after slapping both children for some offense, she bursts into tears. She watches her husband with an intense, almost angry focus, her pale face following his every movement.</p>

<p>Throughout this period, she keeps repeating to herself that what she is doing is right – that she is protecting her family, that Branwen will be better off, that it is necessary. But the anguish and sense of terrible guilt will not leave her. She finds herself wanting to scream every day under the strain.</p>

<h3 id='early-summer-54-bc-the-wolf-incident'>Early Summer 54 BC: The Wolf Incident</h3>

<p>When Segovax and Branwen quarrel during a walk and Branwen disappears into the woods, Cartimandua's reaction is one of complete terror. She goes deathly pale, her jaw drops in horror, and she shouts at her husband and son with a voice hoarse with fear: "Quickly. Find her. Before it's too late." She gives Segovax a look almost of hate.</p>

<p>Cartimandua races up the hill still deathly pale, driven by a single thought: "If the girl was lost, then all was lost." For if anything happens to Branwen, her husband will probably die – she cannot deliver the girl to the nobleman, the bargain will be void, and her husband will not be exempted from the battle.</p>

<p>Branwen is ultimately saved when Segovax kills a wolf that was about to attack her. The incident reveals the depth of Cartimandua's desperation and the terrible bind she has created for herself.</p>

<h3 id='summer-54-bc-the-plan-fails'>Summer 54 BC: The Plan Fails</h3>

<p>When the Romans finally approach and the hamlet prepares to evacuate upriver to safety, the dark-bearded captain arrives to give final orders. He surveys the assembled villagers and selects three men to go as guards with the boats. He orders Cartimandua's husband to go as well, to be in charge and post watches each night.</p>

<p>For a moment, Cartimandua feels a flood of relief. The plan has worked. They are all safe. She starts to sit down in the boat, smiling at the other women and children.</p>

<p>But then her husband speaks: "I cannot."</p>

<p>He explains that he swore an oath to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassivellaunus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassivelaunus</a> himself to fight at Londinos, and produces the brooch the great chief gave him as proof. Cartimandua hears herself gasp and feels herself go very cold. She had not known about this oath – she has scarcely seen him since his return from meeting the chief.</p>

<p>The captain, recognizing that an oath to a chief is sacred, releases him from the evacuation order. He looks at Cartimandua, who has gone an ashen color, and then at Branwen – "a pretty little thing" – but there is nothing to be done. The bargain is off.</p>

<p>As the boats depart, Cartimandua sits silently, staring out at the water while Branwen sleeps against Segovax and the baby rests in her arms.</p>

<h3 id='54-bc-the-battle-and-after'>54 BC: The Battle and After</h3>

<p>The Fisher dies in the battle with the Romans at the ford near Londinos, falling sword in hand as the old druid's second sight had foretold. Segovax, who had secretly paddled downriver overnight to fight beside his father but was too afraid to enter the battle, finds his father's body on the battlefield that evening.</p>

<p>After the Romans depart Britain and life returns to normal, Cartimandua grieves uncontrollably for three months. Then, in a development that greatly surprises young Segovax, she suddenly takes up with another man from a different hamlet. The man is kind to the children, but the boy struggles with his own grief, which persists much longer than his mother's visible mourning.</p>

<p>The speed with which Cartimandua moves on to a new relationship – after all her passionate intensity and desperate schemes to keep her husband alive – suggests either pragmatic survival instinct in a world where women need male protection, or perhaps an inability to sustain the consuming intensity of feeling that had driven her earlier actions. It may also reflect her relief at being released from the guilt and anguish that had tormented her throughout the spring and summer.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='the-fisher'>The Fisher</h3>

<p>Cartimandua's relationship with her husband is defined by an all-consuming passion that drives every major decision she makes. She adores him utterly, desires him, wants to protect him, and needs him. As the text states: "it seemed to her that her passion for her husband was endless." She finds it hard to imagine her existence without him.</p>

<p>This passionate love is complicated by practical concerns. She observes that there are already more women than men in the hamlets along the river, and knows that if he dies in battle, her chances of finding another husband are poor. She is also concerned about how their children would manage without a father, and she desires to have more children with him.</p>

<p>Her love manifests as intense physical awareness – she watches him constantly, following his every move with pale-faced, almost angry intensity. Yet she is also willing to deceive him utterly, making a secret bargain he would never approve of and planning to hide it from him until it is too late to undo.</p>

<p>The Fisher, for his part, seems unaware of his wife's inner turmoil. He is depicted as a good, simple man focused on his work and his duty. When he reveals his oath to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassivellaunus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassivelaunus</a>, it is clear he never discussed this momentous commitment with Cartimandua, suggesting either a communication gap in their marriage or that he made the decision independently, knowing she would object.</p>

<h3 id='segovax'>Segovax</h3>

<p>Cartimandua's relationship with her nine-year-old son is loving but strained by her secret guilt. During the months when she is hiding her bargain, her behavior toward him becomes erratic. She scolds him for no reason, and when Branwen goes missing during the wolf incident, she gives him a look "almost of hate."</p>

<p>Segovax, though only a child, is perceptive enough to notice his mother's strange moods, though he cannot understand their cause. He notes that she has always been mercurial, but recently her moods have been harder to account for. After his father's death, Segovax is surprised and troubled when his mother takes up with another man after only three months of grief, while his own mourning persists much longer.</p>

<h3 id='branwen'>Branwen</h3>

<p>Cartimandua's treatment of her young daughter is perhaps the most revealing aspect of her character. She makes the terrible decision to give Branwen away to the nobleman, rationalizing that the girl will be technically a slave but might learn skills, make a good marriage, and have better opportunities than in their "dull" village.</p>

<p>Yet even as she makes this bargain, Cartimandua is tormented by guilt. After the wolf nearly kills Branwen, she keeps the girl always at her side, driven by the knowledge that if anything happens to her, the bargain will be void and her husband will die. She clutches Branwen tightly, then suddenly sends her away, her behavior swinging wildly between overprotection and rejection.</p>

<p>The relationship reveals Cartimandua's capacity to sacrifice one family member (Branwen) for the sake of another (her husband), while simultaneously being unable to bear the guilt of that choice.</p>

<h3 id='the-dark-bearded-nobleman'>The Dark-Bearded Nobleman</h3>

<p>Cartimandua's interaction with the Celtic captain who agrees to her bargain is marked by a stark power imbalance. He evaluates her sexually, noting her attractiveness while also coldly predicting her future decline. He perceives her as "like an animal from the wild, only half tame" and a "troubled spirit."</p>

<p>Their transaction is purely pragmatic on his side – he sees an opportunity to acquire an attractive young girl who may prove useful or entertaining. Cartimandua approaches him with uncertainty, seeking reassurance about their agreement, anxious that her husband not discover it. When the bargain fails due to the Fisher's oath, the captain looks at the ashen-faced Cartimandua and pretty Branwen with irritation, recognizing that "there was nothing to be done about that now."</p>

<p>The relationship reveals Cartimandua's vulnerability and powerlessness in the male-dominated Celtic warrior society, where a woman's attempts to control her fate require making deals with powerful men on their terms.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Cartimandua lives during one of the most dramatic moments in British history – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julius Caesar</a>'s invasion of Britain in 54 BC. This is Caesar's second attempt to conquer the island, following a reconnaissance expedition the previous year. The Roman force is formidable: five legions (about twenty-five thousand men) and two thousand cavalry.</p>

<p>For the Celtic peoples of Britain, this invasion represents an existential threat. Their world of bardic poetry, rich folklore, and astonishing metalwork has existed behind the northern mists as "a place apart." The Romans, with their superior discipline, armaments, and tactics, represent a terrifying new reality. The Celtic alliance under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassivellaunus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassivelaunus</a> will ultimately be broken at the ford near Londinos, though Caesar will not immediately occupy the island.</p>

<p>Women in Celtic Britain occupy a complex position. The Celts are less patriarchal than the Romans in some ways – Celtic women can own property and even, in some tribes, lead warriors. Yet Cartimandua's situation reveals the practical vulnerability of women in wartime. With men already outnumbering women in the hamlets, the prospect of widowhood means potential poverty and abandonment. Women need male protectors for economic survival.</p>

<p>The practice of taking children as hostages, tribute, or slaves is common in this period. Captured or given children might indeed be raised in noble households, learn skills, and be incorporated into new families. Cartimandua's rationalization that Branwen might be "better off" is not entirely without foundation in the practices of the time, though it also serves her own desperate needs.</p>

<p>The sacred nature of oaths in Celtic society proves decisive in Cartimandua's story. When the Fisher reveals his oath to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassivellaunus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassivelaunus</a>, even the practical-minded captain recognizes he cannot override it: "an oath was a sacred thing." This cultural value system ultimately defeats Cartimandua's carefully laid plans.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Cartimandua represents the human cost of war on non-combatants, particularly women who have no control over the political and military decisions that will determine their fate. While men like her husband can at least choose to fight and win glory (or at least honor) in battle, Cartimandua can only watch helplessly as forces beyond her control threaten to destroy her family. Her desperate bargain is an attempt to exercise agency in a world where she has almost none.</p>

<p>The character explores the moral complexity of survival. Cartimandua's decision to trade one child's freedom for her husband's life is morally questionable, yet Rutherford presents it with psychological complexity rather than simple condemnation. Her terrible guilt, her endless rationalization, her wild mood swings, and her ultimate failure all make her a tragic rather than simply villainous figure. She is a person caught in impossible circumstances, trying to protect those she loves through the only means available to her, and failing despite her sacrifice.</p>

<p>The theme of passionate love versus moral responsibility runs throughout Cartimandua's story. Her all-consuming passion for her husband is both admirable (in its intensity and devotion) and destructive (in how it leads her to betray her daughter and deceive her husband). Rutherford presents passion not as a purely positive force but as something that can be "fearsome" and "terrible," something that can grip and hurl a person forward helplessly.</p>

<p>The irony of Cartimandua's story reinforces the book's recurring theme of the unpredictability of fate. Despite all her planning, scheming, guilt, and sacrifice, her husband dies anyway because of an oath she knew nothing about. Her suffering and moral compromise achieve nothing. This futility suggests that individual human efforts are often swept away by larger historical and cultural forces – in this case, both the Roman invasion and the Celtic culture of sacred oaths.</p>

<p>Finally, Cartimandua's quick transition to a new relationship after her husband's death suggests themes about survival, pragmatism, and the sustainability of intense emotion. Whether this represents her true nature (pragmatic rather than as passionately devoted as she believed), a psychological survival mechanism, or simply the harsh realities of life for women in 54 BC Britain, it provides a sobering coda to her earlier desperate intensity. It suggests that even our most overwhelming emotions and convictions may be temporary, shaped by circumstances that can change with devastating suddenness.</p>
