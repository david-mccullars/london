<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Ricola is a young Anglo-Saxon woman who narrowly escapes execution by drowning in a sack with a snake when she and her husband <a href="characters/Offa-584.html">Offa</a> are saved by <a href="characters/Elfgiva-Godiva-567.html">Elfgiva Godiva</a> and brought to Lundenwic as slaves. Practical, sensual, and remarkably brave, she forms a close bond with her mistress Elfgiva and devises a bold plan to reconcile Elfgiva with her husband <a href="characters/Cerdic-555.html">Cerdic</a>. Though the plan goes dangerously awry and results in her brief sexual encounter with Cerdic, it ultimately succeeds in reuniting the couple. After being sold to a Frisian slave-trader, Ricola is freed when Elfgiva learns she is pregnant, and she and Offa are released to begin their new life together as freepersons.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Ricola is described as having a delicious young body with pink and white flesh, a trace of puppy fat, and soft young breasts. She has a cheerful, round face and short, fair hair (cut as a mark of slavery). The lamplight catches her fair hair, giving it a strange glow. She is sensual and attractive, with small but well-formed breasts. Her physical appeal is noted by both the men at her original village and by Cerdic at Lundenwic.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Ricola is defined by her remarkable combination of practical wisdom, sensuality, courage, and warmth. Despite her youth (approximately fifteen years old), she possesses a level-headed pragmatism that surpasses her husband's more impulsive nature. She is described as "the more practical of the two" in her marriage.</p>

<p>Her personality is characterized by a cheerful independence of spirit and earthy humor. She establishes "a light-hearted banter with the men" at Lundenwic and even makes disrespectful remarks to the foreman "with such good humour that he had just shaken his head and smiled." The men observe, "She doesn't put up with any nonsense, that one."</p>

<p>Ricola is deeply sensual and accepts sensuality as natural. When Cerdic first looks at her with desire, "She was neither surprised nor shocked. She was sensual; she accepted sensuality." This matter-of-fact attitude toward sexuality is part of her earthy, practical worldview.</p>

<p>Despite her humble origins and youth, she possesses remarkable observational skills and emotional intelligence. She carefully studies Elfgiva, learning what it means to be a lady and understanding the older woman's emotional state. She perceives that Elfgiva is "being watched all the time" not just by servants but by her own ancestors in her mind: "She has to behave because she thinks they're watching her."</p>

<p>Her courage is extraordinary. The plan she devises to save her mistress's marriage is "typical of her entire outlook on life: down-to-earth, sensuous, cheeky and, it had to be admitted, extremely brave." When Offa calls her mad for suggesting the plan, she insists, "Think of all she's done for us. Anyway, what've we got to lose?"</p>

<p>She is fiercely loyal and protective, particularly of those she cares about. When discussing whether they should stay with Elfgiva or run away, she becomes indignant at the thought of leaving her mistress: "She saved my life," she explains vehemently. Her maternal instinct is powerful – when she discovers she is pregnant, "within her she already carried a tiny life – the life that belonged to her and Offa alone and which, come what may, she must protect."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-life-c-589-604'>Early Life (c. 589-604)</h3>

<p>Ricola grows up in a small Saxon village in a forest clearing, probably near East Anglia. She marries Offa, a young freeman who possesses only a quarter of a yardland (a "farthing") and must work for others to support himself. Despite their poverty, they are free and presumably content.</p>

<h3 id='604-near-execution-and-enslavement'>604: Near-Execution and Enslavement</h3>

<p>The crisis in Ricola's life comes when her husband Offa, in a moment of rage, attacks the village elder with a pin during a dispute. As punishment, the village elder sentences both of them to death. Ricola is to be drowned in a sack with an adder (snake), while Offa is to "bear the wolf's head" – become an outlaw.</p>

<p>As she stands naked before the assembled villagers, awaiting her terrible death, she looks at Offa with an expression that says only one thing: "You did this to me. I'm going to die. You aren't." Her "cheerful, round face was very white."</p>

<p>At this critical moment, Elfgiva arrives by chance, traveling through the forest. Moved by the young couple's plight and Offa's obvious love for Ricola, Elfgiva purchases them both as slaves with a gold coin, saving their lives. Their hair is cut as a mark of slavery, and they are taken to Lundenwic.</p>

<h3 id='life-at-lundenwic-building-bonds'>Life at Lundenwic: Building Bonds</h3>

<p>Ricola and Offa recover from their ordeal remarkably quickly, "like two puppies who had fallen into water and shaken themselves dry." While Offa is assigned to work with the men in the fields, Ricola is sent to help the women and serves as Elfgiva's personal slave.</p>

<p>Ricola quickly observes the tensions between Elfgiva and Cerdic, noting, "The master's done something bad to her. I still don't know what it is, but she's really suffering. Only being a lady, she's too proud to let it out."</p>

<p>A close bond develops between Ricola and Elfgiva. The older woman takes a liking to the girl, perhaps because she always wanted a daughter. She summons Ricola often, sometimes just to sit with her, and teaches her the art of embroidery. Ricola watches Elfgiva trace designs on fine linen with colored silk threads, using techniques with gold wire. "Finding the girl's fingers were nimble, Elfgiva would often let her put in a stitch or two, amused to see the slave girl's delight in the process."</p>

<p>Through these intimate moments, Ricola studies Elfgiva carefully, learning about the life of nobility. She begins to understand what makes a lady different: "You know what it is. It's as if she is being watched all the time... Even when I'm alone with her... it's her own family. Her dead father, his father, the whole lot of them, generations back." When Offa asks if she'd like to be a lady, Ricola gives an earthy laugh: "What, and have that lot to carry around on my back all the time? I'd sooner get in that sack with the snake! It's too much trouble."</p>

<p>Despite this pragmatism, Ricola develops genuine affection and compassion for her mistress. She sits with Elfgiva on nights when the older woman allows "silent tears to run down her face." When Wistan flees from his father's anger, Ricola and Offa hide him in their tiny hut: "It's the one place the master won't think of looking for him."</p>

<p>Ricola also perceives the growing attraction Cerdic has for her. When he first looks at her after weeks without intimacy with his wife, she notes matter-of-factly: "He hasn't had a woman in a week, she thought, and passed on." She decides to "keep clear of him" and wisely chooses not to tell Offa.</p>

<h3 id='the-yuletide-plan-a-dangerous-gambit'>The Yuletide Plan: A Dangerous Gambit</h3>

<p>As Yuletide approaches and it becomes clear that Elfgiva will be divorced and sent away, Ricola forms a bold plan to reconcile the couple. She explains her reasoning to Offa: "She can't make up her mind. She thought she'd lost him; now she knows she could have him back. She wants to give in, but she's so afraid of losing him again that she can't bring herself to make the move." Ricola believes Elfgiva just needs "one little push."</p>

<p>The plan is crude but calculated: allow Cerdic to see her apparently available and interested, have Offa fetch Elfgiva, and force Elfgiva to choose between taking her husband back or losing him to another woman. "She isn't going to have him sleeping with her own slave right in front of her. She'll put a stop to that quickly, and there's only one way a woman can do that."</p>

<p>On Yuletide eve, Ricola positions herself outside her hut after the feast. When Cerdic passes by, she engages him in conversation, "laughing at something the master had just said, head a little thrown back. She was friendly, naturally warm, enticing without actually provoking him."</p>

<p>But the plan goes wrong. Offa is delayed inside the hall by a garrulous farmer talking to Elfgiva. As time passes, Cerdic becomes increasingly excited. Ricola calculates carefully: "She needed the merchant to go just so far and no further." When Cerdic begins kissing her and his hand finds her breast, she thinks desperately, "Not yet, she wanted to scream. Not yet."</p>

<p>When Elfgiva finally arrives, she sees her husband kissing Ricola. But rather than responding as Ricola predicted, Elfgiva simply dismisses the scene as beneath her notice. To the high-born lady, Ricola is "only a slave. She was not a rival. Hardly even an embarrassment. She was a chattel to be used for the night if her husband had nothing better to do, to be discarded at will."</p>

<h3 id='consequences-and-near-disaster'>Consequences and Near-Disaster</h3>

<p>Ricola cannot escape from Cerdic and spends the night with him. As she lies in his powerful arms, "her mind had drifted to her husband, then to Elfgiva. What would tonight mean to them all? To her marriage, her position with her mistress, her future relationship with the merchant?"</p>

<p>What Ricola doesn't know is that "within her she already carried a tiny life" – she is pregnant with Offa's child.</p>

<p>The next morning, Elfgiva – having spent a sleepless night reflecting on her choices and ultimately deciding to take control of her marriage – announces she will convert to Christianity. But she adds a firm condition: "The slave girl goes."</p>

<p>Cerdic immediately agrees: "The girl goes." When Ricola and Offa try to explain, Elfgiva "silenced them at once when they started trying to explain themselves. She had no wish to hear."</p>

<p>A Frisian slave-trader arrives that very day, and Cerdic sells Ricola and Offa to him along with other northern slaves. The couple is placed in the slave quarters with no contact with anyone. When Ricola tries to speak to Elfgiva or scream her message, the Frisian whips her cruelly.</p>

<h3 id='the-desperate-appeal'>The Desperate Appeal</h3>

<p>As the slaves are led to the ship at dawn, Ricola makes desperate attempts to get her message to Elfgiva. She whispers to the cook: "I'm pregnant. Tell the Lady Elfgiva. Quickly!" But the woman "did not move."</p>

<p>She calls to the foreman: "I'm pregnant. Won't you just tell the mistress that? I'm pregnant." He stares at her "as calmly as if she were a piece of livestock," and the Frisian's whip comes down.</p>

<p>Finally, in desperation, Ricola screams at the top of her lungs: "I'm pregnant! Lady Elfgiva! I'm pregnant! Can't you understand? Pregnant! I've got a child!" The fourth blow of the whip cuts deep, nearly causing her to pass out as she's dragged into the boat, babbling uselessly: "A baby... I'm having a baby."</p>

<p>Sitting in the boat awaiting departure, Ricola contemplates her fate. She knows what happens to pregnant slave women: they're unlikely to be kept with their husbands, and their babies are often drowned at birth. "What use was a baby to a master?" She stares at the boat's "high, curving prow. How cruel it seemed, like some great, cold blade about to strike through the waters."</p>

<h3 id='freedom-restored'>Freedom Restored</h3>

<p>Elfgiva has heard Ricola's cries. Combined with her own newly awakened sense of fertility from the night before (she herself has just conceived), Elfgiva takes pity on the young couple and orders them brought back.</p>

<p>There is little conversation. Elfgiva is brief and imperious: "You're lucky not to be on the slave ship. And now you may count yourselves luckier still. I am giving you back your freedom. Go where you want, but never show your faces at Lundenwic again."</p>

<h3 id='new-beginnings'>New Beginnings</h3>

<p>Offa and Ricola don't go far. Down by the ford on Thorney Island, Offa constructs a crude hut, building it up with snow walls. Young <a href="characters/Wistan-588.html">Wistan</a> brings them a haunch of venison, promising to check on them.</p>

<p>As they settle into their new life, Offa tends to Ricola's wounds, using fat from the venison to make oil for the welts on her neck and shoulders. "She winced as he touched them, but said nothing as he went to work."</p>

<p>They never speak of the night she spent with Cerdic. When Offa asks, "Is it true you're pregnant?" and she nods, "he felt a sense of both joy and relief. Somehow the merchant's intrusion into his life seemed marginal now."</p>

<p>Offa promises: "We'll manage here for a few days. Then I'll think of something. The river was long. Its valley was lush. The river would look after them."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='offa'>Offa</h3>

<p>Ricola's relationship with her husband is characterized by deep love, mutual loyalty, and complementary personalities. Though Offa is more impulsive and optimistic, declaring "We won't be slaves for long. I'll think of something," Ricola is "the more practical of the two," yet "she quite believed him."</p>

<p>When facing execution in their village, Ricola knows "she loved him," even as her expression says, "You did this to me." Their bond survives the terrible ordeal of near-execution, enslavement, and even Ricola's night with Cerdic.</p>

<p>After they are freed, when Offa asks about her pregnancy, "he felt a sense of both joy and relief. Somehow the merchant's intrusion into his life seemed marginal now." They protect the life they have created together, and Ricola sees the child as "the life that belonged to her and Offa alone and which, come what may, she must protect."</p>

<h3 id='elfgiva-later-godiva'>Elfgiva (later Godiva)</h3>

<p>Ricola's relationship with Elfgiva is complex and multi-layered. It begins as a simple master-slave relationship but develops into something more intimate. Elfgiva takes a liking to Ricola, perhaps because she always wanted a daughter, and teaches her embroidery and allows her into her confidence.</p>

<p>Ricola becomes Elfgiva's companion during her darkest hours, sitting with her when she cries and helping her in practical ways. She studies the older woman carefully, learning what it means to be a lady while maintaining her own earthy independence.</p>

<p>Ricola's loyalty to Elfgiva is profound: "She saved my life," she tells Offa vehemently. This loyalty drives her to devise the dangerous plan to reconcile Elfgiva with Cerdic, even at great personal risk.</p>

<p>However, the relationship reveals its limitations when Elfgiva dismisses Ricola's liaison with Cerdic. Ricola had "not fully understood" that to Elfgiva, "the girl was still only a slave. She was not a rival. Hardly even an embarrassment. She was a chattel to be used for the night if her husband had nothing better to do, to be discarded at will."</p>

<p>When Elfgiva orders Ricola sold, she refuses to hear any explanations, having "no wish to hear." Only Ricola's desperate cries about being pregnant – combined with Elfgiva's own newly awakened fertility – finally moves Elfgiva to mercy.</p>

<h3 id='cerdic'>Cerdic</h3>

<p>Ricola's relationship with Cerdic is brief but significant. She notices his attention after he has been without his wife for weeks and pragmatically decides to keep clear of him. However, her plan to help Elfgiva requires using his attraction to her advantage.</p>

<p>On Yuletide eve, she engages with him skillfully, "friendly, naturally warm, enticing without actually provoking him." But she miscalculates the timing, and unable to escape, she spends the night with him.</p>

<p>In his arms, "her mind had drifted to her husband, then to Elfgiva. What would tonight mean to them all?" The encounter is not described as traumatic – Ricola's sensual, practical nature allows her to endure it – but it is clearly not of her choosing.</p>

<p>The next day, when Cerdic watches the freed couple by the jetty, "he was tempted to give the girl a present, but thought better of it," suggesting perhaps some small guilt or acknowledgment of what occurred.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Ricola's story takes place during a pivotal moment in Anglo-Saxon England: the conversion to Christianity at the beginning of the seventh century (604-605). She lives through the arrival of Bishop Mellitus and witnesses the early establishment of Christianity in the Thames Valley region.</p>

<p>Her status as a young peasant woman highlights the harsh realities of Anglo-Saxon justice and social structure. The punishment decreed for her – drowning in a sack with a snake – reflects the brutal Saxon <i>doom</i> (judgment) system. As the text notes, "Saxon justice was harsh."</p>

<p>Her near-enslavement and actual brief period of slavery illustrate the fluidity of status in Anglo-Saxon society. People could move from freedom to slavery through crime, debt, or misfortune. As noted in the text, "the majority of slaves came to that condition not through war, or even the raids of cruel slave-traders," but through various social mechanisms.</p>

<p>The slave trade was a significant part of the economy. England "had become well known for its slaves. They were sold all over Europe." Even the Pope himself, seeing "fair-haired English slaves in the marketplace in Rome, had famously pronounced: 'They are not Angles, but angels.'"</p>

<p>Ricola's status as a woman in this society is complex. She has little formal power but exercises considerable practical influence. Her relationship with Elfgiva shows both the potential for female solidarity across class lines and the strict limitations imposed by social hierarchy.</p>

<p>The religious context of the chapter affects Ricola directly. She is present at Bishop Mellitus's sermon and baptisms, and like Offa, she is baptized into Christianity. The new religion's message of love and redemption influences Offa's decision to go along with her plan: "It was something more general, a feeling he had taken from the preacher that somehow, thanks to this wonderful new god, everything would be all right."</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<h3 id='courage-and-agency-in-constrained-circumstances'>Courage and Agency in Constrained Circumstances</h3>

<p>Ricola embodies the theme of exercising agency despite severe constraints. As a young, poor, female slave, she has almost no formal power, yet she finds ways to influence her circumstances. Her plan to reconcile Elfgiva and Cerdic is an act of remarkable courage, as Offa notes: "extremely brave." She risks everything – her safety, her relationship with her mistress, her marriage – to help someone who saved her life.</p>

<p>Even when her plan goes wrong and she faces being sold as a slave, she fights desperately to save herself and her unborn child, screaming her pregnancy despite the brutal whippings. Her refusal to give up, even when all seems lost, demonstrates extraordinary resilience.</p>

<h3 id='the-complexity-of-female-relationships-across-class-lines'>The Complexity of Female Relationships Across Class Lines</h3>

<p>The relationship between Ricola and Elfgiva explores the possibilities and limitations of female solidarity in a rigidly hierarchical society. They share moments of genuine intimacy – Elfgiva teaching Ricola embroidery, Ricola comforting Elfgiva in her distress – yet the class barrier remains absolute.</p>

<p>Ricola's realization that "the girl was still only a slave" to Elfgiva, despite their closeness, reveals the harsh reality that personal affection cannot overcome social structure. Elfgiva can "dismiss her from her mind just as she wished," highlighting how power relations ultimately define their connection.</p>

<h3 id='practical-wisdom-versus-social-status'>Practical Wisdom versus Social Status</h3>

<p>Throughout the chapter, Ricola displays a practical wisdom that often surpasses that of her social superiors. She correctly diagnoses Elfgiva's emotional state, understands what needs to happen to reconcile the couple, and devises a plan that ultimately succeeds (despite going awry in execution).</p>

<p>Her earthy observations – like noting that Elfgiva teeters like "a woman... on a riverbank, unable to make up her mind whether to jump into the stream" – show a psychological insight that comes from her clear-eyed, pragmatic worldview. Her comment about not wanting to be a lady because of having to "carry around on my back all the time" all those ancestral expectations reveals a philosophical depth beneath her common origins.</p>

<p>Ricola's pregnancy becomes central to her story's climax. The fierce protective instinct she feels for "the tiny life – the life that belonged to her and Offa alone and which, come what may, she must protect" drives her desperate screaming on the slave ship.</p>

<p>Significantly, it is the connection between Ricola's pregnancy and Elfgiva's own newly conceived child that finally moves Elfgiva to mercy. "It was not only Ricola's cry that had brought her down. It was the cry together with something else – the something that had passed between husband and wife in Cerdic's hall that mothers' night." This moment of female solidarity through shared fertility transcends the class barrier that had kept them apart.</p>

<h3 id='the-price-of-survival'>The Price of Survival</h3>

<p>Ricola's story illustrates the compromises and sacrifices required for survival in a harsh world. She must accept slavery to avoid death, endure Cerdic's sexual advances to save her mistress's marriage, and ultimately lose her home at Lundenwic despite (or because of) her loyalty.</p>

<p>Yet the novel suggests these compromises, while painful, enable life to continue. She ends the chapter free, with her husband, carrying their child, and with hope for the future. The "river was long. Its valley was lush. The river would look after them."</p>
