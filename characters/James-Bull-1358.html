<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>James Bull is an honest, forthright ironmonger from a modest branch of the Bull family who becomes entangled in the dramatic events of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. His unwavering honesty and determination to elevate his family's position lead him on a years-long campaign to marry his wealthy cousin <a href="characters/Gilbert-Bull-1330.html">Gilbert Bull</a>'s daughter <a href="characters/Tiffany-Bull-1365.html">Tiffany</a>, a pursuit that ultimately fails but inadvertently places him at one of the most pivotal moments in English history. He eventually marries <a href="characters/Dame-Barnikel-1346.html">Dame Barnikel</a> and establishes the Bull Brewery.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>At eighteen years old, James is described as tall, sturdy, fair-haired, and broad-faced—a man his Saxon ancestors would have recognized as one of their own immediately. He has staring blue eyes that convey his absolute honesty. He is a big, spare fellow with a red face. His physical presence is imposing but somewhat clumsy in refined society.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>James Bull embodies the quality of being forthright above all else. His staring blue eyes tell everyone at once that he is absolutely honest—he never breaks his word and never even thinks of doing so. This honesty extends to an almost naïve directness in social situations, as when he bluntly tells Tiffany that the idea was he should marry her.</p>

<p>He is utterly reliable and trustworthy. His family, parents, brothers, and sisters all depend on him, and his mother proudly declares that "everybody trusts him." In the modest ironmonger's business, everyone swears by him, and the family believes he will lead them to greater things.</p>

<p>His honesty comes with a certain lack of social sophistication. He is confident that his transparent honesty will win people over, telling his father about approaching Gilbert Bull: "He can't possibly mind when he sees that I'm honest." He lacks the ability to read subtle social cues and situations, as evidenced by his puzzled reaction when Gilbert dismisses him and his later belief that the interview "went rather well."</p>

<p>James possesses tremendous determination and does not give up easily. Even after years of no contact from his wealthy cousin, he remains hopeful and continues to believe in his plan. This persistence extends to his pursuit of Tiffany, to whom he sends flowers and a poem years after their first meeting.</p>

<p>Deep in his bones, James knows what is right and proper. When he sees Tyler's men enter London, he immediately recognizes them as troublemakers who "must be put down." This instinctive conservatism and respect for order proves himself to be "a true Bull."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1376-the-first-approach'>1376: The First Approach</h3>

<p>At age eighteen, James conceives a plan to transform his family's fortunes. The family of ironmongers has not encountered the rich Bulls of Bocton for over eighty years, and the modest ironmonger's business has never produced more than enough to feed the family for three generations. Despite his parents' misgivings about potential humiliation, James sets out confidently to visit his wealthy cousin Gilbert Bull on London Bridge.</p>

<p>His proposal is characteristically direct: he suggests that by marrying Gilbert's only daughter Tiffany, he would ensure Gilbert's fortune stays in the Bull family name. When Gilbert asks what would happen if he had a son, James responds with puzzled honesty: "Well I shouldn't think it's likely now, sir, is it?" Gilbert dismisses him politely but firmly, saying he will send for James if needed. James leaves believing the interview went "rather well," demonstrating his inability to read the situation.</p>

<h3 id='1377-the-street-encounter'>1377: The Street Encounter</h3>

<p>More than a year passes with no word from Gilbert, but James remains undiscouraged, telling his family "the girl's still young." On a wet November afternoon, entering the city through Ludgate, he spots a young girl with fair hair and a bright, intelligent face—Tiffany. Following his rule of truthfulness, he blocks her path and blurts out: "I think the idea was that I should marry you. I told him I'd be interested."</p>

<p>Tiffany, who has never heard of him, is initially alarmed but becomes intrigued by his persistence. When he asks how he can make her like him, she playfully suggests he could "rob a rich man and give the money to the poor." As the rain falls, James's honest, earnest approach seems to touch her, and she tells him: "You should never give up."</p>

<p>That night, James gets drunk for the first time in his life at the George Tavern in Southwark. <a href="characters/Dame-Barnikel-1346.html">Dame Barnikel</a> sits with him and offers comfort, warning him about swarthy highwaymen who end up swinging on gallows and encouraging him to "stay honest the way you are." James falls asleep drunk, imagining a swarthy highwayman swinging while he watches with Tiffany on his arm, muttering: "I'll show them."</p>

<h3 id='1381-the-peasants-revolt'>1381: The Peasants' Revolt</h3>

<p>Five years pass with no summons from Gilbert. James even sends Tiffany flowers and a poem, which go unacknowledged. When Wat Tyler's rebels enter London during the Peasants' Revolt, James knows instinctively what must be done—they must be put down. Keeping his distance but eyeing them with deep suspicion, he follows their progress to the Savoy Palace.</p>

<p>By providential timing, James encounters a rebel with a white patch in his hair and burned hands near London Bridge. He throws himself on the man, crying "Got you," and is astonished when his cousin Gilbert appears and identifies the rebel as <a href="characters/Geoffrey-Ducket-1361.html">Geoffrey Ducket</a>, calling him a looter. Gilbert later praises James as a "capital fellow. Grown up sound, I must say. I may have misjudged him when he was younger."</p>

<p>James's eagerness to serve the authorities is so obvious that Alderman Philpot procures him a horse and arms, saying "You can make yourself useful." James hardly leaves Philpot's side through the climactic events.</p>

<h3 id='the-death-of-wat-tyler'>The Death of Wat Tyler</h3>

<p>At Smithfield, James witnesses the confrontation between young King Richard II and Wat Tyler. Managing to edge forward until he is only sixty yards from Tyler, behind the mayor's shoulder, James stares at the rebel leader's swarthy face. As Tyler issues his demands and drinks ale crudely, smacking his lips, James suddenly remembers—this is the same swarthy man from the George years ago, the one Dame Barnikel had described as a highwayman.</p>

<p>In a moment that enters English history, James blurts out across Smithfield: "I know that fellow. He's a highwayman from Kent."</p>

<p>The effect is devastating. Tyler goes red, loses his head, and with a roar of rage charges straight at James with a dagger, yelling "I'll have you dead." In the scuffle that follows, the mayor and a squire strike Tyler, who crashes to the ground streaming blood. James hears Philpot mutter: "They'll kill us all, damn it." But fourteen-year-old King Richard II performs an extraordinary feat of courage, riding into the midst of the rebel crowd and leading them away while loyal London forces gather.</p>

<h3 id='triumph-and-disappointment'>Triumph and Disappointment</h3>

<p>Flushed and excited, James rides to Gilbert Bull's house and is ushered upstairs for the first time to the big room where the family eagerly asks him to tell everything as it happened. His triumph is complete—he has finally earned his wealthy kinsman's approval.</p>

<p>But one month later, Tiffany becomes betrothed to <a href="characters/Benedict-Silversleeves-1352.html">Benedict Silversleeves</a>. James looks very thoughtful and says quietly: "That's it then." He realizes his life suddenly has no purpose. He begins frequenting the George Tavern again, where Dame Barnikel takes him "under her wing," making the big, spare fellow feel attractive and telling her daughter Amy: "A man is what you make of him."</p>

<h3 id='the-wedding-party'>The Wedding Party</h3>

<p>James is invited to a gathering at Gilbert's house where various eligible young men are presented to Tiffany (her father having given her one chance to choose someone other than Silversleeves). James is the only exception in terms of eligibility, invited with a shrug simply because he is a kinsman. Though initially flustered, he begins to feel at ease.</p>

<p>When Ducket appears disguised as a nun and attempts to kill Silversleeves to save Tiffany from the unwanted marriage, chaos erupts. Tiffany throws herself out the window into the Thames below. As Bull struggles with his robe and Silversleeves sinks to his knees in prayer, James waves his arms wildly crying "A rope! Fetch a rope!" In his haste, he clambers across the room, knocks over a table, and crushes Gilbert's precious astrolabe entirely. But it is Ducket who saves Tiffany by diving in after her.</p>

<h3 id='marriage-and-the-bull-brewery'>Marriage and the Bull Brewery</h3>

<p>One month after Tiffany's wedding to <a href="characters/Ben-Carpenter-1362.html">Ben Carpenter</a>, Dame Barnikel makes an announcement: "I'm going to marry James."</p>

<p>She has decided she can make something of him, and James concludes that while not the fortune he dreamed of, the George Tavern is "a good and solid business." Dame Barnikel tells the guild: "He's going to become a brewer," and they do not dare argue with the formidable landlady. Thus the Bull Brewery is born, transforming James from a modest ironmonger into a tavern owner and brewer—achieving prosperity, if not in the way he originally imagined.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='gilbert-bull'>Gilbert Bull</h3>

<p>James's wealthy cousin represents everything James hopes to achieve for his family. Gilbert initially dismisses the young ironmonger's presumptuous proposal but warms to him considerably after James captures the rebel Ducket, praising him as having "grown up sound." However, Gilbert's approval comes too late to fulfill James's matrimonial ambitions. He invites James to Tiffany's wedding party, but only as an afterthought and clearly as the least eligible candidate.</p>

<h3 id='tiffany-bull'>Tiffany Bull</h3>

<p>James pursues Tiffany doggedly for five years, sending flowers and poems that go unacknowledged. Their street encounter in the rain reveals an interesting dynamic—Tiffany is charmed by his earnest, honest persistence even as she finds him somewhat amusing. She encourages him not to give up, perhaps enjoying the novelty of being pursued, but never seriously considers him as a marriage prospect. For James, the betrothal of Tiffany to Silversleeves marks the end of a dream that has defined his life for years.</p>

<h3 id='dame-barnikel'>Dame Barnikel</h3>

<p>The formidable landlady of the George becomes James's unlikely benefactor and eventually his wife. She first comforts him when he gets drunk after meeting Tiffany, offering practical advice and maternal warmth. Years later, after his hopes are finally dashed, she takes him "under her wing," recognizing his potential and his need for guidance. Her decision to marry him is pragmatic but also affectionate—she believes she can "make something of him." The partnership proves mutually beneficial, combining James's honesty and work ethic with her business acumen and forceful personality.</p>

<h3 id='geoffrey-ducket'>Geoffrey Ducket</h3>

<p>James's capture of Ducket during the Peasants' Revolt is a pivotal moment that earns him Gilbert Bull's approval. Though James acts from instinct and civic duty rather than personal animosity, his identification of the "looter" has serious consequences for Ducket, who is locked up until King Richard's general pardon saves him. Ironically, it is Ducket who later saves Tiffany's life while James merely waves his arms and destroys Gilbert's astrolabe.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>James Bull lives through one of the most turbulent periods in English medieval history. The 1370s see the final years of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward III</a>'s reign and the tension of the "Good Parliament" of 1376, which attempts to reform the government and address corruption surrounding the aging king. When James first approaches Gilbert Bull, his wealthy cousin is returning from Westminster depressed by seeing "the old king being savaged by the Commons men," reflecting the breakdown of traditional hierarchies that troubles men like Gilbert.</p>

<p>The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 represents a crisis of the feudal order. Sparked by the poll tax and decades of social tension following the Black Death, the revolt brought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Tyler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wat Tyler</a> and thousands of rebels to London, demanding the abolition of lordship, the end of bishops (except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ball_(priest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Ball</a>)), and equality of all men under the king. James's instinctive conservatism—his immediate recognition that the rebels "must be put down"—reflects the views of the established urban craftsmen and merchants who saw the revolt as a threat to order rather than a just cause.</p>

<p>James's role in Tyler's death, though inadvertent, places him at one of the defining moments of the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_II_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard II</a>. His identification of Tyler as a highwayman provokes the rebel leader's fatal charge, leading to Tyler's death at the hands of the mayor and a squire. The fourteen-year-old king's courage in rallying the rebels and the London forces' subsequent encirclement mark the effective end of the revolt in London, though brutal reprisals follow in the countryside.</p>

<p>James represents the aspirations of the modest urban craftsman class in late medieval London. The ironmongers, grocers, and other lesser crafts looked up to the great merchant families who dominated city politics and grew wealthy through international trade. Marriage between branches of wealthy families was common, but the social gulf between James's impoverished ironmongers and Gilbert's rich merchant household illustrates the stratification within a single family name across just a few generations.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>James Bull embodies the theme of honest persistence in the face of social barriers. Unlike the schemers and manipulators who populate the merchant class, James's transparent honesty is both his greatest strength and his limitation. He genuinely believes that being forthright and trustworthy should be enough to win approval and advancement, a touching naïveté that both endears him to readers and ensures his romantic failure.</p>

<p>His story illustrates the complex web of family connections that runs through London's history. The Bulls, like the other families in the novel, have branched into prosperous and impoverished lines. James represents the poorer relations who look to wealthy cousins for advancement—a common pattern in London's merchant families. His ultimate success in founding the Bull Brewery shows that prosperity could be achieved through different paths than the one he originally envisioned.</p>

<p>James serves as an agent of historical consequence through sheer accident. His blurted identification of Wat Tyler is not the result of cleverness or heroism but simply his honest recognition of a face from years before. That this random act should precipitate Tyler's death and James's brief moment of historical significance speaks to the novel's theme of how ordinary individuals become caught up in great events. The fact that Dame Barnikel's casual warning about a swarthy highwayman years earlier proves prophetic adds to the interconnectedness of seemingly minor moments.</p>

<p>The contrast between James's bumbling heroism and Ducket's genuine heroism (saving Tiffany from drowning) is pointed. James waves his arms and destroys Gilbert's precious astrolabe while Ducket risks his life. Yet it is James who earns the merchant's approval and invitation to the wedding party, while Ducket remains the disgraced apprentice. This irony underscores the novel's examination of how social standing and perception often matter more than actual merit or courage.</p>

<p>His marriage to Dame Barnikel represents a realistic, pragmatic form of success. She recognizes that "a man is what you make of him" and decides she can shape James into a successful brewer. Their partnership—her formidable will and business sense combined with his honest reliability—creates the Bull Brewery, adding another branch to the family's commercial enterprises. This outcome suggests that while romantic aspirations may fail, practical partnerships built on complementary strengths can prosper.</p>
