<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Frederick Meredith was the second son of Colonel Meredith and <a href="characters/Violet-Bull-1889.html">Violet Bull</a>, younger brother to <a href="characters/Henry-Meredith-1894.html">Henry</a> and older brother to <a href="characters/Helen-Meredith-1903.html">Helen</a>. Born around 1900, he was too young to fight in the Great War but came of age during the 1920s as a handsome young officer who served as a military attaché in Poland.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Described as handsome, though no other specific physical details are provided in the text.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>As a young boy, Frederick worshiped his older brother Henry and looked to him as a model. When family disputes arose over their mother's suffragette activities, Frederick, only eight years old, closed his mind to the conflict, unable to reconcile his adoration of both his mother and his brother when they were at odds.</p>

<p>In adulthood, Frederick developed into a dashing figure, the type of man who was "considered an asset at any party" during the post-war 1920s. His sister Helen suspected he led something of a secret life, with occasional mysterious disappearances to Europe suggesting involvement in intelligence or military matters beyond his official duties.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='childhood-1908-1913'>Childhood (1908-1913)</h3>

<p>In December 1908, at age eight, Frederick was boarding at a preparatory school. Unlike his older brother Henry at Charterhouse, Frederick was shielded from much of the controversy surrounding their mother's suffragette activities. The news of <a href="characters/Violet-Bull-1889.html">Violet's</a> accosting Prime Minister Asquith had "hardly reached him."</p>

<p>To the young boy, his mother remained "the angel, the kindly vision he dreamed of when he was lonely." He hero-worshipped his older brother Henry, and when conflict arose between Henry and their mother over her suffragette campaigning, Frederick could not reconcile the dispute and simply closed his mind to the whole subject.</p>

<h3 id='adulthood-1920s-1940'>Adulthood (1920s-1940)</h3>

<p>Frederick was "just too young to fight" in the Great War, sparing him the horrors that damaged his brother Henry. This timing proved fortunate, as the war's devastating casualties created a shortage of young men in the post-war years.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, Frederick became known as "handsome young Frederick Meredith" and was "considered an asset at any party, especially with the shortage of men after the losses of the war." He had taken up flying and on one memorable summer day flew his sister Helen across the Channel to an aerodrome in France.</p>

<p>Frederick pursued a military career, eventually serving as a military attaché to the British embassy in Poland. In this capacity, he gained first-hand knowledge of German rearmament in the mid-1930s. During a visit to London, he warned his sister Helen that Hitler was actively preparing for war, contradicting the complacent official British position. He reported that "every embassy in Europe knows it perfectly well" and that "every military attaché, including myself, has been filing detailed reports which London is studiously ignoring."</p>

<p>His sister Helen suspected that Frederick's occasional disappearances to Europe "might have something to do with a more secret life," suggesting possible involvement in intelligence work beyond his official diplomatic duties.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='henry-meredithhenry-meredith-1894html'><a href="characters/Henry-Meredith-1894.html">Henry Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Frederick idolized his older brother from childhood. As an eight-year-old boy, his hero-worship of Henry was so strong that when Henry came into conflict with their mother over her suffragette activities, Frederick could not process the disagreement and blocked out the entire controversy.</p>

<h3 id='helen-meredithhelen-meredith-1903html'><a href="characters/Helen-Meredith-1903.html">Helen Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Frederick maintained a warm, affectionate relationship with his younger sister. He teased her good-naturedly, calling her "a flapper" in the 1920s, and shared his aviation enthusiasm with her, once flying her to France. More seriously, he confided in her about the dangerous political situation in Europe during his time as a military attaché, trusting her with information that contradicted official British policy.</p>

<h3 id='violet-bullviolet-bull-1889html'><a href="characters/Violet-Bull-1889.html">Violet Bull</a></h3>

<p>As a young child, Frederick adored his mother and viewed her as an angelic figure. Unlike Henry, who actively opposed their mother's suffragette campaigning, Frederick was largely sheltered from the controversy during his preparatory school years.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Frederick's life spanned a tumultuous period in British history. Born at the height of the Edwardian era, his childhood coincided with the militant suffragette campaign that brought his mother notoriety and imprisonment. His adolescence was shaped by the Great War, though he was fortunate to be too young to serve.</p>

<p>Coming of age in the 1920s, Frederick belonged to the generation that survived the war's demographic devastation. The shortage of young men made eligible bachelors like him particularly sought after in society. His military career placed him at the intersection of diplomacy and intelligence during the dangerous years leading up to World War II, when he witnessed first-hand the rearming of Nazi Germany while Britain pursued a policy of appeasement.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Frederick represents the fortunate few who narrowly missed the Great War's slaughter by accident of birth year. His role as a military attaché in Poland in the 1930s illustrates the disconnect between what British officials in Europe observed about Hitler's intentions and what London chose to believe—a tragic failure of intelligence that contributed to Britain's unpreparedness for World War II.</p>

<p>His character also embodies the transition from the privileged Edwardian childhood of the upper-middle class to the more adventurous, less sheltered life of the interwar generation, taking to the skies and serving in foreign posts during an era of growing international tension.</p>
