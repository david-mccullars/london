<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Edmund Meredith is an ambitious gentleman whose life spans the late Elizabethan through the Cromwellian eras. Initially seeking fame as a playwright to replace Shakespeare, his theatrical ambitions end in spectacular failure when his play is sabotaged by the very man he mocked. He reinvents himself as an Anglican clergyman, demonstrating remarkable political adaptability by switching from High Church Royalist to Presbyterian Parliamentarian during the English Civil War. Throughout his life, Edmund embodies the theatrical nature of both public performance and personal survival, never losing his essential charm and wit even as he navigates the turbulent religious and political changes of 17th-century England.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>As a young man in 1597-1599 (early twenties):</p>
<ul>
<li>Handsome with auburn hair</li>
<li>Fashionably dressed in richly embroidered doublet, woolen stockings, billowing galligaskins secured with ribbons, embroidered shoes in outer slippers, starched white ruff, short cape, rapier with gold pommel and matching dagger, soft scented leather gloves, golden ring in right ear, high-brimmed hat with three gorgeous plumes</li>
<li>Carried a long curved clay tobacco pipe (though disliked the taste; used it to ward off smells of "garlic-breaths and onion-breaths")</li>
<li>Had "smoky eyes"</li>
</ul>

<p>During his transformation (autumn 1597):</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopted more workmanlike appearance: simple brown clothes, smaller hat with single feather, rough beard</li>
</ul>

<p>In old age (1649-1653):</p>
<ul>
<li>Looked twenty years younger than his late seventies</li>
<li>Silvery hair cut to hang along jawbone (deliberately clumsy Puritan fashion)</li>
<li>Long aristocratic fingers, half-closed contemplative eyes</li>
<li>Wearing black sleeveless jerkin, black and white striped shirt with large white linen collar and cuffs, black breeches</li>
<li>By his final sermon: so thin and gaunt that people gave "an involuntary gasp, as though they were seeing a ghost"</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Edmund Meredith's defining characteristic is his desire to "cut a figure in the world" - to be noticed, admired, and remembered. This singular ambition drives all his choices, from theatrical pretensions to religious opportunism. He is witty and charming, excelling at verbal repartee and social manipulation, yet capable of surprising honesty when cornered that paradoxically works in his favor.</p>

<p>His personality combines genuine intelligence with shallow vanity. He dismisses Shakespeare as merely "an actor with a remarkable wit" and believes himself superior due to his legal education and gentle birth. Yet he possesses real capability - his legal acumen saves the Lord Chamberlain's Men when he discovers the loophole allowing them to dismantle and move the Theatre to create the Globe.</p>

<p>Edmund demonstrates remarkable adaptability and political instinct. He switches religious allegiances seamlessly, analyzing power dynamics with lawyer's precision. When the Civil War begins, he concludes Parliament will win "because London's where the money is" and adjusts accordingly. This chameleon-like survival ability, combined with deliberately vague theological language that prevents anyone from pinning down his actual beliefs, allows him to thrive through decades of religious turmoil.</p>

<p>Despite his opportunism, Edmund maintains capacity for genuine feeling. His relationship with <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a> reveals authentic affection, and he remains her trusted confidant throughout their lives. However, his ambition ultimately trumps his heart - when Jane returns from Virginia and marriage seems possible, he realizes that a wife touched by scandal might compromise his prospects, and he lets her go with the sad words: "But they might suspect."</p>

<p>In his final years, Edmund achieves a kind of artistic transcendence, using his theatrical gifts in service of religious performance. His sermons become so spiritually ambiguous yet emotionally powerful that stern Puritan women faint and their husbands weep. His death, collapsing from the pulpit at St Paul's Cross while crying "Come hither" to heaven, is "the best thing he had ever done" - a final theatrical triumph.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-years-c-1575-1595'>Early Years (c. 1575-1595)</h3>

<p>Edmund was born around 1575 to Thomas Meredith (who had married late in life, when he was about 68 years old) and a woman of good family with some fortune but "some small blemish on her character" that prevented her getting married earlier. His mother died shortly after giving birth to Edmund. Thomas himself was "not long for this world" and sent his infant son and heir to Rochester to be raised by his sister Susan (then in her late 60s/early 70s) and her son Jonathan Bull (then in his late 40s/early 50s). Susan described Edmund as "a handsome little fellow with auburn hair" with "great charm," though she worried he was "just a little too wild."</p>

<p>His father left him a modest income sufficient for a single gentleman. Knowing that "quiet old Rochester would never do," Edmund came to London seeking to make his mark. He considered the royal court, but the failures of his father and grandfather deterred him. He studied at the Inns of Court, nearly completing his legal studies, but found law "too dry, too tedious." His cousins the Bulls were brewers, but he vowed: "I'll not dirty my hands with trade."</p>

<h3 id='theatrical-ambitions-1597-1599'>Theatrical Ambitions (1597-1599)</h3>

<p>By 1597, Edmund had chosen playwriting as his path to fame. The theatre was becoming fashionable, with playwrights earning substantial fees and courtly respect. He had contributed extra lines to comedies and scenes that were praised, especially his witty repartee for young gallant characters. The Lord Chamberlain's company agreed to take a full play from him for six pounds.</p>

<p>His first play, <em>Every Man Hath His Wit</em>, was a sophisticated courtly comedy meant for the new indoor Blackfriars theatre - a play to be "heard" not "seen." He courted <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a>, the fifteen-year-old daughter of the company's wardrobe keeper, attracted by her youth, prettiness, theatrical connections, and modest legacy. He boasted to friends that he would replace Shakespeare, dismissing the playwright's work as "fustian stuff" (except for <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, which he assumed Shakespeare had help writing).</p>

<p>At a bear-baiting at the Curtain, Edmund encountered <a href="characters/Orlando-Black-Barnikel-1562.html">Orlando Black Barnikel</a>, a dark-skinned privateer. Edmund mockingly engaged the stranger in witty banter, boasting that his pen was mightier than the dagger, that he could make anyone immortal through drama, and that he could portray a person as hero or villain at will: "Upon the stage, sir, in the hands of a poet, a character is tethered like that bear upon a chain." Black Barnikel quietly replied: "I shall come to your play then, young master."</p>

<h3 id='failure-and-transformation-1597-1598'>Failure and Transformation (1597-1598)</h3>

<p>Edmund's sophisticated play was rejected by the Admiral's men as "too good for us, too fine." He fell into "profound gloom." During summer, he pursued Lady Redlynch, a widow, and they became lovers. She deceived him about her influence at court and ability to help his play. Meanwhile, he neglected Jane, allowing <a href="characters/John-Dogget-1570.html">John Dogget</a> to court her.</p>

<p>By autumn, Edmund abandoned his courtly affectations. He dressed simply, grew a beard, and announced he would write a new play for common audiences. He studied dramatic structure from old scripts Jane procured and wrote a spectacular play about the Spanish Armada with battles, cannon fire, and grandiloquent speeches. The play featured a villainous "Blackamoor" pirate - captain of a ship who commits theft and rape, cunning and loathsome, eventually caught and executed. The character was clearly inspired by his encounter with Black Barnikel.</p>

<p>When the Theatre's lease expired and the Chamberlain's Men faced disbanding, Edmund transformed from playwright seeking patronage to unpaid legal counsel. He discovered the crucial loophole: the Theatre building belonged to the Burbages even if the land did not. He spent three weeks studying legal precedent at Staple Inn, then led the extraordinary operation to dismantle the Theatre and transport it across the frozen Thames in December 1598. When Alderman Ducket tried to trap them at the bridge, Edmund brilliantly replied: "But, sir, surely you forget. This is Shoreditch. We are not in London. You have no authority here." Jane observed he had become "a new man entirely," showing "quiet determination" and "thoroughness."</p>

<p>The timbers were used to construct the Globe Theatre on Bankside. Edmund had lent the Burbages 55 pounds and they promised to stage his play.</p>

<h3 id='the-plays-disaster-1599'>The Play's Disaster (1599)</h3>

<p>When Edmund's Spanish Armada play finally performed at the new Globe, disaster struck. Black Barnikel attended, sitting prominently in the Lords' Room. His presence distracted the audience completely. Instead of watching the play, spectators compared the actor portraying the villainous Blackamoor with the real man sitting above them, making jokes and throwing nuts, fruit, and cheese rinds. Edmund realized his play had "no heart, no soul" - it was "laughed off" the stage.</p>

<p>Jane comforted him afterward, walking him home and giving him a long kiss. Soon after, Black Barnikel took his revenge by kidnapping Edmund (wrapped in a sail) and abducting Jane as his prize. Edmund survived this abduction, but Jane disappeared.</p>

<h3 id='turn-to-holy-orders-1615'>Turn to Holy Orders (1615)</h3>

<p>For fifteen years after the theatrical disaster, Edmund struggled. None of his three subsequent plays were produced. His reputation as the gallant who lost Jane Fleming sustained him through three brief fashionable affairs, his verses circulating widely: "Since she I loved was taken away." But as years passed and the court became more mercenary, his Elizabethan gallantry lost appeal.</p>

<p>At forty, desperate and uncertain, Edmund took holy orders. Following the example of John Donne, who told him "You could go far if you can preach a good sermon," Edmund saw the church as another kind of stage. When asked why he chose holy orders, he accidentally blurted the honest truth: "Because I saw no other way to turn." This honesty, ironically, worked in his favor.</p>

<p>Donne helped him secure the living at St Lawrence Silversleeves, a rich parish endowed by Silver Ducket fifty years before. The vestry was led by Sir Jacob Ducket, who strongly disapproved of Edmund and tried to intimidate him. However, when young Julius Ducket innocently asked if the king had spoken for him, Edmund charmingly confirmed it was so. The other vestrymen were swayed. Sir Jacob added one condition: "Do not forget that we expect a good sermon."</p>

<p>Edmund became a successful preacher, much in demand outside his parish for handsome fees. Sir Henry Ducket invited him to monthly dinners, pleased to have a gentleman as vicar.</p>

<h3 id='ambition-for-dean-of-st-pauls-1630'>Ambition for Dean of St Paul's (1630)</h3>

<p>By 1630, nearing sixty, Edmund set his sights on becoming Dean of St Paul's when John Donne died. To impress the new Bishop of London, William Laud, Edmund implemented High Church reforms. He moved the altar from the nave back to the chancel, adopted elaborate vestments costing forty pounds in gold thread and sequins (the Fleming workshop's largest order since Shakespeare's <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>), and preached a controversial sermon on "Humility and Obedience" attacking Puritanism, declaring bishops ruled by Divine Right and ordering strict church attendance: "Be humble. And obey."</p>

<p>The congregation was stunned, but three days later the Bishop's secretary requested a copy - Edmund had succeeded.</p>

<h3 id='janes-return-1630'>Jane's Return (1630)</h3>

<p>Two weeks after the reforming sermon, a well-dressed widow calling herself Mrs. Wheeler visited Edmund. It was Jane, returned from Virginia after years married to a farmer named Wheeler who left her well-provided. The reunion was deeply emotional. Edmund recognized marriage had entered both their minds.</p>

<p>Jane revealed she had been abducted by Black Barnikel, asking Edmund to keep it secret. Edmund's reaction was complex and painfully honest. The thought of her being with a Blackamoor was distasteful yet "strangely exciting." But the deeper issue troubled him: "Can the Dean of St Paul's have a wife whom the world might suspect of being touched by a Blackamoor?" He thought of John Dogget living in the very parish. His sad conclusion: "But they might suspect." They parted with expressions of regard.</p>

<h3 id='marriage-and-political-survival-1630-1642'>Marriage and Political Survival (1630-1642)</h3>

<p>Edmund failed to become Dean of St Paul's. Perhaps to console himself, he married Matilda, a respectable thirty-year-old spinster and lawyer's daughter who had fallen in love with his sermons. They had a child the following year; he eventually had five living children. He chose a large house in Blackfriars.</p>

<p>When the English Civil War began in 1642, Edmund demonstrated brilliant political acumen. He analyzed the military situation and concluded Parliament would win "because London's where the money is" - the Roundheads controlled the navy, ports, and customs dues. He switched from High Church Royalist to Presbyterian Parliamentarian, surviving "just in time" when Parliament abolished bishops and ejected many clergy. That same year he helped tear down the old cross in Cheapside, declaring: "Such things are superstition and idolatry." Even stern Scottish Presbyterians confirmed: "The man Meredith preaches a fine sermon. Very sound."</p>

<h3 id='jane-and-doggets-affair-1644-1653'>Jane and Dogget's Affair (1644-1653)</h3>

<p>Throughout the Civil War, Edmund and Jane maintained close friendship. Around 1644-1645, Jane and <a href="characters/John-Dogget-1570.html">John Dogget</a> (now in his sixties) became lovers. Only Edmund guessed the truth, and Jane trusted his discretion. Edmund repeatedly warned her: "Soon you will be in danger. Perhaps great danger."</p>

<p>In 1653, Martha Carpenter (Dogget's estranged wife) discovered the affair through her nephew Gideon. She prosecuted them for adultery - a capital offense under Puritan law. Edmund warned urgently: "Curse these saints with their moralizing and their witch-hunts... the penalty for adultery nowadays is death."</p>

<p>At the crowded Guildhall trial, despite irrefutable evidence, the jury returned "Not guilty." English juries, Edmund knew, hadn't entirely lost their humanity - of 23 known adultery cases in London, only one secured conviction.</p>

<p>However, community punishment was severe. Dogget's life became "simply unendurable" and Jane was greeted with cries of "Whore!" on the street. Someone painted "HARLOT" on her door. Edmund told them: "You can't stay in the parish. They won't have you." In late January 1653, they moved to Petty France near Westminster, where Edmund advised: "At least Martha and her friends won't bother you there."</p>

<h3 id='final-sermon-and-death-1653'>Final Sermon and Death (1653)</h3>

<p>By 1653, Edmund was in his eighties, so gaunt that people gasped as if "seeing a ghost." He had adapted brilliantly to the Puritan regime by using language that took flight while remaining theologically impossible to pin down. His sermons focused on death, using texts like "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace." Stern Puritan women fainted at his words; their husbands wept.</p>

<p>At St Paul's Cross before hundreds, Edmund gave his final sermon using text from Revelation. He climbed the pulpit with difficulty, his white hair hanging to his shoulders, hollowed eyes producing awed hush. Reaching his crescendo as sun broke through clouds, he cried: "I saw a new heaven and a new earth... Come with me, dearly beloved, come to that place." Staring straight at the sun, arms outstretched: "He calls to me, He that is Alpha and Omega, He calls to me now: 'Come hither. Come hither.'" With a crash, he fell from the pulpit, never to rise. This sermon was "the best thing he had ever done."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='jane-fleming'>Jane Fleming</h3>

<p>Edmund's relationship with Jane spans over fifty years and represents the most genuine connection of his life. He initially courted her pragmatically at fifteen - young enough to be "moulded," connected to theatre, with a modest legacy. Yet authentic affection developed. When Jane was abducted, Edmund became the source of rumors about her kidnapping, maintaining belief she lived when her parents thought her murdered.</p>

<p>Their reunion in 1630 revealed depths on both sides. Edmund was moved to see his long-lost love; Jane appraised him with calm wisdom. But Edmund's ambition won: marriage to a woman suspected of being with a Blackamoor might compromise his prospects. His rejection - "But they might suspect" - is one of his saddest moments.</p>

<p>Despite this, their friendship endured. Jane became the only person with whom Edmund was completely frank, dropping all masks. He warned her repeatedly about danger and protected her secret about Dogget. After her trial, he secured their exile to safety. She gently teased him, knowing all his calculations and compromises, yet remained devoted.</p>

<h3 id='black-barnikel-orlando-barnikel'>Black Barnikel (Orlando Barnikel)</h3>

<p>Edmund's encounter with Black Barnikel at the bear-pit shapes both their fates. Edmund's witty mockery, declaring his pen mightier than the dagger and boasting he could make the Moor a villain "tethered like that bear upon a chain," demonstrated both his cleverness and fatal arrogance. When Edmund wrote his Spanish Armada play featuring a villainous Blackamoor pirate, he made an enemy of a formidable man.</p>

<p>Black Barnikel's attendance at the Globe premiere destroyed Edmund's theatrical ambitions. His revenge - kidnapping Edmund and abducting Jane - was calculated: rather than kill Edmund (which would result in hanging), he stole what Edmund valued. Edmund's words about the power of characterization proved prophetic, but ironically it was Black Barnikel who became immortal (in Shakespeare's <em>Othello</em>) while Edmund's plays were forgotten.</p>

<h3 id='william-shakespeare'>William Shakespeare</h3>

<p>Edmund consistently underestimated Shakespeare, dismissing him as "just an actor with a remarkable wit" with "a little Latin and no Greek." He praised only <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, assuming Shakespeare had help, and called the history plays "fustian stuff, but popular." Edmund believed himself cut from "finer cloth" due to his education and gentle birth.</p>

<p>Yet they worked together during the Theatre crisis, and Shakespeare grinned in approval at Edmund's legal brilliance. The irony is profound: Edmund sought to replace Shakespeare but contributed instead to creating the Globe where Shakespeare's greatest tragedies would premiere - including <em>Othello</em>, likely inspired by the very incident that ended Edmund's theatrical career.</p>

<h3 id='sir-jacob-and-julius-ducket'>Sir Jacob and Julius Ducket</h3>

<p>Edmund's relationship with the Duckets spans decades. Sir Jacob initially intimidated him at the vestry interview but accepted defeat gracefully, adding: "Do not forget that we expect a good sermon." Edmund preached to Sir Jacob weekly for years. Only young Julius Ducket showed him immediate kindness, innocently helping secure the position.</p>

<p>Decades later, Julius (now head of the vestry) took a conciliatory approach when Edmund's reforming zeal waned. After Edmund's death, Julius became quite friendly with Richard Meredith, Edmund's physician son.</p>

<h3 id='john-dogget'>John Dogget</h3>

<p>Edmund's relationship with Dogget is complex and understated. They were friendly in the 1590s, both courting Jane. Dogget tried to court Jane when Edmund neglected her for Lady Redlynch, showing selfless kindness. Decades later, when Dogget and Jane became lovers in their sixties, only Edmund guessed the truth. Rather than judge, Edmund warned them of danger and ultimately helped them escape persecution. His protection of their secret showed growth from the arrogant young gallant who mocked a stranger at a bear-pit.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Edmund Meredith's life spans one of England's most turbulent periods - from Elizabeth I's final years through the English Civil War and into the Cromwellian Commonwealth (c. 1575-1653). His story illustrates how individuals navigated massive religious and political upheavals through calculated adaptation.</p>

<p>The Elizabethan theatrical world Edmund entered was experiencing its golden age. Playhouses like the Theatre and Curtain in Shoreditch represented new cultural institutions where playwrights could achieve fame and fortune. The proposed Blackfriars indoor theatre represented an attempt to elevate drama to courtly sophistication. Edmund's ambition to replace Shakespeare reflected real social mobility available through artistic success - though also the precariousness of theatrical reputation.</p>

<p>The construction of the Globe in 1599, to which Edmund contributed through his legal expertise, became one of history's most famous theatres. His role in the dismantling and reconstruction demonstrates how legal knowledge intersected with theatrical enterprise. The incident of Black Barnikel at the premiere may have inspired Shakespeare's <em>Othello</em> (c. 1603), making Edmund an unwitting contributor to theatrical history.</p>

<p>Edmund's turn to holy orders in 1615 reflects a genuine path for educated gentlemen. The church offered income, status, and (for talented preachers) significant influence. John Donne's career from poet to Dean of St Paul's exemplified this trajectory. The acquisition of livings through vestry approval rather than solely through bishops' patronage shows the mixed ecclesiastical governance of the period.</p>

<p>The religious conflicts Edmund navigated were existential. William Laud's High Church reforms in the 1630s attempted to restore ceremonial worship that Puritans considered "superstition and idolatry." The English Civil War (1642-1651) was fundamentally a religious war as much as political. Parliament's adoption of Presbyterianism and abolition of bishops in 1643 overturned the entire ecclesiastical structure. That Edmund survived by switching allegiances demonstrates both the chaos of the period and the practical necessity of adaptation.</p>

<p>The Puritan Commonwealth's legal regime attempted to enforce Old Testament morality. The adultery law that threatened Jane and Dogget with death represented Cromwellian moral extremism - yet the jury's acquittal shows ordinary English people's resistance to such severity. Of 23 known adultery cases, only one secured conviction. Community punishment through shunning and public shaming, however, remained devastatingly effective.</p>

<p>Edmund's final years saw the height of Puritan influence. His success despite multiple religious reversals illustrates a key survival strategy: theological vagueness. By preaching with emotional power but doctrinal ambiguity, he appealed to various factions. His death in 1653, before the Restoration (1660), spared him one final required transformation.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Edmund Meredith embodies several central themes in <em>London</em>: ambition and its costs, performance and authenticity, survival through adaptation, and the theatrical nature of both art and life.</p>

<p>His arc from aspiring playwright to clergyman demonstrates that "all the world's a stage" - a metaphor he himself articulated to Black Barnikel. Every phase of Edmund's life involves performance: the fashionable gallant with three plumes, the determined lawyer saving the theatre company, the High Church vicar in gold-threaded vestments, the Presbyterian preacher in deliberately clumsy hair, the dying prophet collapsing from the pulpit. Each role is calculated for effect, yet Edmund's genius lies in making calculation appear spontaneous.</p>

<p>The relationship between words and power forms a crucial theme. Edmund's boast that his pen was mightier than Black Barnikel's dagger proved both true and false. True because Edmund's theatrical work helped create the Globe where Shakespeare wrote <em>Othello</em> (possibly inspired by Black Barnikel); false because Edmund's own play failed spectacularly and his mockery brought devastating personal consequences. His success ultimately came not from writing plays but from writing (and performing) sermons - words in service of survival rather than art.</p>

<p>Edmund's life also illustrates the cost of ambition on personal relationships. His rejection of Jane - "But they might suspect" - crystallizes his character. He genuinely cared for her, yet ambition trumped love. This makes him tragic rather than simply opportunistic. He achieved respect and influence, but died without having attained the position (Dean of St Paul's) he most desired, and without the woman who truly knew him.</p>

<p>The theme of adaptation and survival runs throughout. Edmund's seamless religious transformations - Anglican to High Church to Presbyterian - demonstrate both moral flexibility and political acumen. His famous assessment that "London's where the money is" shows clear-eyed analysis beneath theatrical flourishes. He survives because he reads power accurately and adjusts before necessity forces humiliation.</p>

<p>Finally, Edmund represents the tension between genuine talent and shallow ambition. He possessed real abilities - legal brilliance, verbal wit, dramatic instinct - but deployed them primarily for self-advancement. Yet his final sermon suggests transcendence: collapsing while crying "Come hither" becomes authentic spiritual theatre, "the best thing he had ever done." Whether he experienced genuine religious feeling or simply perfected his performance remains deliberately ambiguous - an ambiguity that defined his entire career.</p>

<p>In the larger narrative of <em>London</em>, Edmund Meredith shows how individuals navigate historical forces through calculated performance while retaining capacity for authentic feeling. He is neither hero nor villain but a survivor - charming, flawed, adaptable, and ultimately human.</p>
