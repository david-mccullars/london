<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Rufus is a cheerful, gregarious former legionary who works in the port of Londinium in AD 251. A proud Roman citizen and member of the exclusive Temple of Mithras, he represents the optimistic, social-climbing aspirations of provincial Romans in Britain. His attempts to secure his son <a href="characters/Julius-231.html">Julius</a>'s future through his connections at the Mithraic lodge form a key thread in the chapter.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Rufus is described as round and rubicund, with a round, cheerful face that turns red as a berry when he drinks or laughs. He shares with his son Julius a distinctive physical trait: a mass of black curls with a patch of white hair at the front. His red-faced, merry appearance contrasts sharply with his wife's pale, phlegmatic demeanor.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Rufus is characterized by his unfailing cheerfulness and optimism. He is merry, loves to sing, and enjoys telling funny stories to friends and neighbors. His personality stands in stark contrast to his Celtic wife, who is pessimistic and never laughs at his jokes.</p>

<p>He is gregarious by nature and belongs to several associations in Londinium. He takes enormous pride in two things: his Roman citizenship (earned by his grandfather through military service before Emperor Caracalla made citizenship widely available) and his membership in the exclusive Temple of Mithras, where only sixty or seventy people could be admitted.</p>

<p>Despite his easy-going nature, Rufus has a conscience about his son Julius. He had hoped Julius would become a legionary as he had been, viewing it as the most secure employment in the Roman Empire. When Julius showed no interest, Rufus didn't push him, but he began to feel pangs of conscience that he should do something to help establish the young man. His solution is to use his connections at the Mithraic lodge to find Julius a business opportunity.</p>

<p>Rufus is somewhat naive and trusting. He dismisses his wife's warnings about Julius falling in with bad company (specifically Sextus the carpenter), believing his son "can't come to much harm." He is also oblivious to the criminal activities his son has been engaged in, having no idea that Julius has been counterfeiting coins.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='background-and-family'>Background and Family</h3>

<p>Rufus's grandfather, though only a provincial Celt, earned the coveted status of Roman citizenship through service in an auxiliary regiment. His grandfather also married an Italian woman, allowing Rufus to claim Roman blood in the family. When Rufus was a child, Emperor Caracalla made citizenship available to nearly all freemen in the empire, diminishing the exclusivity of his status, but Rufus still takes pride in telling his son: "We were citizens before that, you know."</p>

<p>Rufus served as a legionary in his youth and retired to work in the port of Londinium. He lives modestly near the lower western gate of the city wall with his Celtic wife and two children.</p>

<p>His marriage appears stable if not particularly warm. His wife is a congenital pessimist who rarely speaks and never laughs at his jokes. Despite their differences in temperament, they work together to raise their children and maintain a household that can entertain neighbors with feasts after the games.</p>

<h3 id='ad-251-the-games'>AD 251: The Games</h3>

<p>On the day before the great games in the amphitheater, Rufus approaches Julius with exciting news. Through his connections at the Mithraic lodge, he has arranged for Julius to meet two men who might set him up in "a useful little business" and provide stake money. That evening, he takes Julius to an open meeting at the Temple of Mithras.</p>

<p>Rufus is visibly nervous about the meeting, wanting desperately for Julius to make a good impression. "You'll be fine," he mutters to himself as much as to his son. "You won't let me down." As they approach the temple, he instructs Julius: "Just sit quietly, now. Don't say anything. Watch."</p>

<p>Inside the temple, Rufus and Julius sit near the back among the relatively humble members. Rufus whispers proudly to his son: "The lodge can fix almost anything in this city." During the ceremony, when the Raven (actually the centurion who will interview Julius) conducts the ritual, Rufus leans over and tells Julius that this is one of the men he will meet.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, the centurion approaches and discusses a business opportunity with Julius – bringing pottery from the interior of the island to the port, with good pay and chances to trade on his own account. When the centurion pronounces Julius acceptable and says he'll work with his agent (the mariner), Rufus blushes with pleasure. "Well done, boy. You're in," he whispers, believing the evening has brought everything he could wish.</p>

<p>Walking home under a quarter-moon, Rufus is in a merry mood, filled with a father's pride. "Nothing was better, he thought, than a father's pride." He had long ago given up with his daughter, but with his son, he feels he has truly done a good job. "You could be set up for life," he tells Julius contentedly.</p>

<h3 id='the-day-of-the-games'>The Day of the Games</h3>

<p>The following day, during the great games in the amphitheater, Rufus hosts a feast for the neighbors. His round, cheerful face now red as a berry, he tells his friends funny stories while his fat daughter consumes her third chicken. When Julius fails to appear at the feast, Rufus dismisses his wife's concerns with a grin: "He's after some woman. Don't you worry."</p>

<p>Rufus remains oblivious to the danger his son is in – unaware of the forged coins, the theft from the Governor's Palace, the deadly triangle involving Julius, Sextus, and the mariner's wife. His wife has not told him about discovering the bag of forged coins in Julius's room.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='juliusjulius-231html'><a href="characters/Julius-231.html">Julius</a></h3>

<p>Rufus loves his son deeply and takes great pride in him, though he worries about Julius's future prospects. He had hoped Julius would follow in his footsteps as a legionary, but when the young man showed no interest, Rufus didn't force the issue. However, his conscience troubles him, and he feels it's time to do something concrete to help establish Julius in life.</p>

<p>His relationship with Julius is warm and affectionate. They play draughts together in the evenings, and Rufus takes pleasure in beating his son at the game while teasing him about being distracted by women. When he successfully arranges the business opportunity through the Mithraic lodge, Rufus is filled with paternal satisfaction.</p>

<p>However, Rufus is also somewhat naive about his son's character and activities. He dismisses his wife's warnings about Julius's association with Sextus the carpenter, and he has no idea that Julius has been counterfeiting coins or that the young man is pursuing the mariner's wife – the very man on whom Julius's new business opportunity depends.</p>

<h3 id='wife'>Wife</h3>

<p>Rufus's relationship with his wife is marked by a stark contrast in temperament. Where he is merry and loves to sing, she is silent and never laughs. Her hair is pulled in a tight bun, her eyes never shine, and her face remains phlegmatically pale. She speaks little, and when Rufus tells jokes, she only stares.</p>

<p>Despite these differences, there is a functional domestic partnership. She is kind enough, and Rufus believes she loves the family. They work together to manage the household and prepare feasts for neighbors. However, she is of Celtic descent and carries the burden of ancestral memories of Roman conquest. "Those Romans are all the same. They get you in the end," she warns repeatedly – a litany Julius has heard throughout his childhood.</p>

<p>Rufus appears to tolerate or perhaps not even notice her pessimism, maintaining his cheerful disposition regardless of her dour outlook.</p>

<h3 id='daughter-the-fat-girl'>Daughter (the fat girl)</h3>

<p>Rufus has "long ago given up" with his daughter, suggesting resignation rather than active engagement. The girl has grown enormously fat since childhood, a mystery to Rufus who wonders: "I don't know how she got like that." He speculates that she might take after an aunt his father mentioned who was very big, but he has no real explanation for her condition.</p>

<p>Unlike his relationship with Julius, Rufus seems to have little hope or expectation for his daughter's future.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Rufus embodies the social mobility and integration that Roman rule brought to Britain by the mid-third century AD. His grandfather's generation had to earn citizenship through military service, and even then it was a rare honor for provincial Celts. By Rufus's childhood, Emperor Caracalla had extended citizenship to nearly all freemen in the empire, democratizing what had once been an exclusive privilege.</p>

<p>Yet Rufus clings to the distinction that his family were citizens "before that" – a touching example of how even diminished status markers remain important to those who hold them. His pride in his Italian grandmother and his "Roman blood" shows how provincial families constructed hybrid identities that bridged Celtic and Roman cultures.</p>

<p>His membership in the Temple of Mithras is equally significant. Mithraism was particularly popular among soldiers and merchants – respectable, upwardly mobile men who valued its emphasis on honor, courage, and purity. The religion's exclusivity (only sixty or seventy could fit in the Londinium temple) made membership a mark of social distinction. For a former legionary of modest means working in the port, membership in the Mithraic lodge represented both spiritual commitment and social achievement.</p>

<p>Rufus's career path – military service followed by civilian work and business connections – was typical for legionaries in the peaceful province of Britain. Veterans received good pensions and stake money to start businesses, and their military networks often translated into civilian opportunities. Rufus is attempting to pass on these advantages to his son by leveraging his Mithraic connections.</p>

<p>The chapter is set in AD 251, a time when the Roman Empire was experiencing political instability (five emperors were proclaimed that year alone) but Britain remained "a haven of peace and modest prosperity." Rufus represents the provincial Roman who has benefited from this stability and hopes to secure his family's position in the established order.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Rufus represents the successful integration of provincial peoples into Roman culture and the social mobility that empire could provide. His family's trajectory from Celtic auxiliaries to proud citizens with Italian ancestry illustrates how Roman Britain was creating a hybrid Romano-British culture.</p>

<p>His character also embodies a certain naivety about the stability of Roman order. His pride in his citizenship and lodge membership, his faith in "doing things the right way," and his belief that connections and honest work will secure his son's future all rest on assumptions about social order and predictability. He has no idea that his son is involved in counterfeiting, theft, and adultery – crimes that could destroy everything Rufus has worked to build.</p>

<p>The contrast between Rufus's optimism and his wife's Celtic pessimism ("Those Romans are all the same. They get you in the end") suggests the deeper tensions in Romano-British society. While Rufus has embraced Roman identity, his wife carries the memory of conquest and resistance. Their marriage embodies the uneasy merger of cultures in Roman Britain.</p>

<p>Finally, Rufus's pride in exclusivity (his early citizenship, his Mithraic membership) even as those markers become less exclusive reflects a universal human tendency to cling to distinctions of status and belonging. His character is both sympathetic – a loving father trying to help his son – and slightly comic in his earnest pride over honors that are becoming commonplace.</p>
