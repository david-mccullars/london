<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Branwen is the young daughter of the Fisher and Cartimandua, living in a small Celtic hamlet near Londinos in 54 BC. At approximately six years old during the events of Caesar's invasion, she is a spirited, athletic child with bright blue eyes and fair hair, known for her fearless nature, quick wit, and legendary temper that even her parents cannot control. Her fate becomes entangled in her mother's desperate bargain to save the family from the coming Roman invasion.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Branwen is described as having a "tiny, athletic body" and "bright blue eyes." She has fair hair, which sets her apart in appearance from her dark-haired brother Segovax and contributes to her being noticed by the dark-bearded noble. Despite her small size, she displays remarkable physical courage and agility, being willing to climb trees "even he [Segovax] hesitated to tackle."</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Branwen possesses an extraordinary temperament that defines much of her character. Her temper is so fierce that "not even his parents could control" it, yet this same passionate nature becomes her salvation when confronted by mortal danger. She displays an unusual combination of fearlessness and quick thinking that belies her young age.</p>

<p>Despite her volatile moods, Branwen has an "affectionate nature" and forms a close bond with her older brother Segovax. When frustrated or denied something she believes is rightfully hers, she becomes absolutely intransigent, her face turning "puce" with rage, tears welling from her eyes, and her entire body expressing fury through stamping, screaming, and even physical violence.</p>

<p>Yet beneath this tempestuous exterior lies genuine courage and sharp intelligence. When faced with a wolf in the woods, she demonstrates remarkable presence of mind, recognizing that running would mean death and instead choosing to face down the predator using the only weapon she possesses: her own temper. This quick-witted bravery reveals a survival instinct and cleverness that suggest she may grow into a formidable woman.</p>

<p>Her relationship with her brother is typical of siblings—filled with both affection and conflict. She can be manipulative when thwarted, once hiding from Segovax to get him in trouble, and is not above using the threat of crying or making noise to get her way. Despite these occasional tricks, there is genuine love between them, and she desperately wants to accompany him on his nighttime journey to their father, showing both her attachment to her family and her desire to be included in important matters.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='early-childhood-c-60-54-bc'>Early Childhood (c. 60-54 BC)</h3>

<p>Branwen grows up in a Celtic hamlet on a gravel spit near Londinos, living with her family in one of the circular thatched huts within the hamlet's wattle stockade. Her early years are spent playing in the meadows along the southern riverbank, strewn with buttercups, cowslips, and primroses. She lives a simple life typical of Celtic peasant children, under the watchful eye of her mother and the protective care of her brother.</p>

<h3 id='the-wolf-incident-spring-54-bc'>The Wolf Incident (Spring 54 BC)</h3>

<p>The most significant event in Branwen's young life occurs when she wanders into the woods after a quarrel with Segovax over his spear. In her anger, she runs up the slope into the trees and hides, making her brother search for her—a trick she has played before. However, this time she encounters a gaunt, mangy wolf that has strayed from its pack.</p>

<p>When the wolf approaches to within twenty feet, Branwen's quick thinking saves her life. Understanding instinctively that running would be fatal, she decides to face the creature down using her temper as a weapon. She works herself into a genuine fury, clapping her hands, shouting, stamping her foot, and hurling obscenities at the wolf with such conviction that the animal backs away, uncertain. Though the wolf eventually sees through her bluff and prepares to attack, Segovax arrives in time and kills it with his spear.</p>

<p>Her mother's reaction to this near-tragedy is extreme and puzzling to the children. Cartimandua's terror goes beyond normal maternal fear, as Branwen's survival is crucial to a secret bargain the mother has made. From that day forward, Cartimandua keeps Branwen "always at her side," never letting her out of her sight.</p>

<h3 id='the-secret-bargain'>The Secret Bargain</h3>

<p>Unknown to Branwen, her mother has made a terrible deal with the dark-bearded noble who commands the defenses at Londinos. In exchange for keeping Branwen's father safe from the coming battle with the Romans, Cartimandua has agreed to give Branwen to the captain. The girl would technically become a slave, belonging to the captain at the court of the great chief Cassivelaunus, though Cartimandua convinces herself that this might actually be an opportunity for her daughter—better than "waiting around this village where everything was so dull."</p>

<p>The bargain is to be fulfilled "at the summer's end," with Branwen to be delivered to the captain. This explains Cartimandua's extreme anxiety when Branwen nearly dies from the wolf attack, as such an "accident" would destroy the bargain and leave her husband unprotected.</p>

<h3 id='the-druids-prophecy'>The Druid's Prophecy</h3>

<p>When Cartimandua seeks guidance from the old druid, desperate to understand her situation, she receives a cryptic and terrible oracle: "There are three men whom you love, and you are going to lose one of them." This prophecy throws Cartimandua into agonized confusion—the three men can only be her husband, Segovax, and the baby, but she cannot determine which one she will lose, causing her to become even more protective and anxious about all her children, particularly Branwen.</p>

<h3 id='the-roman-invasion-and-the-broken-bargain-summer-54-bc'>The Roman Invasion and the Broken Bargain (Summer 54 BC)</h3>

<p>When the Romans finally arrive and the evacuation of women and children is ordered, the dark-bearded captain initially assigns the Fisher to guard the boats and accompany the families upriver—fulfilling the bargain. However, at the last moment, the Fisher reveals that he has sworn an oath to Cassivelaunus himself to fight at Londinos, displaying a brooch the great chief gave him as proof.</p>

<p>The captain, bound by the sacred nature of oaths in Celtic culture, must honor this and cancels the arrangement. The bargain is broken—not through any fault of Cartimandua's, but through circumstances beyond her control. Branwen is never delivered to the captain, and her father goes to fight and die at the Battle of Londinos.</p>

<h3 id='after-the-battle'>After the Battle</h3>

<p>Following her father's death, Branwen continues to live with her family in the hamlet. She is present when her brother Segovax, still grieving, sits by the gravel spit months later. Though she plays with him initially, she eventually wanders away, leaving him alone when the old druid arrives to help the boy find peace with his father's death.</p>

<p>Her mother, after three months of uncontrollable grief, takes up with another man from a neighboring hamlet, who is described as kind to the children. Branwen's own reaction to these events and her adjustment to her new family situation is not recorded, though one can imagine the impact of losing her father and gaining a stepfather at such a young age.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='segovax'>Segovax</h3>

<p>Branwen's relationship with her older brother is complex and deeply affectionate despite frequent conflicts. She both admires him and challenges him, demanding to be included in his activities and refusing to accept his authority as her older brother. Their quarrel over his spear leads to the wolf incident, yet when he saves her life, she is genuinely joyful and excited on his behalf.</p>

<p>She demonstrates both manipulation (hiding to get him in trouble) and genuine attachment (wanting desperately to accompany him to battle). On the night Segovax steals away to reach their father, Branwen discovers him and insists on coming along, threatening to cry and wake everyone if he refuses. Her final interaction with him in the chapter—sitting together "having tired of their games"—suggests a continuing bond despite the traumas they have endured.</p>

<h3 id='cartimandua'>Cartimandua</h3>

<p>Branwen's relationship with her mother is characterized by Cartimandua's increasingly strange behavior, which the little girl observes with puzzlement. She knows her mother is "strange" but cannot understand the source of her anxiety and mood swings. After the wolf incident, she finds herself kept constantly at her mother's side, never allowed to wander freely again.</p>

<p>During the druid's visit to sacrifice at Londinos, Branwen accompanies her mother on a mysterious search for the priest, witnessing her mother's agitated state. Most traumatically, she watches from above as Cartimandua consults the druid and then releases a "terrible, wailing scream" that frightens even the ravens—a sound and moment that Branwen remembers "as long as she lived."</p>

<h3 id='the-fisher'>The Fisher</h3>

<p>Though Branwen's relationship with her father receives less attention in the narrative than Segovax's, the text indicates a loving bond. Before departing for battle, the Fisher attempts to tell Branwen "to be good," but finds the idea so absurd (given her ungovernable nature) that he simply laughs and gives her "a hug and a kiss instead." This moment captures both his acceptance of her spirited nature and his affection for her.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Branwen lives during one of the most pivotal moments in British history—Julius Caesar's second invasion of Britain in 54 BC. As a child of peasant fisherfolk, she represents the ordinary Celts whose lives were disrupted by Rome's expansion. Her father's decision to honor his oath to Cassivelaunus rather than accept safety exemplifies the Celtic values of honor and tribal loyalty that characterized this warrior culture.</p>

<p>The secret bargain her mother makes also reflects the harsh realities of Celtic society, where women and children could be given away or enslaved, and where the line between slavery and opportunity was not always clear. That Cartimandua could rationalize giving her daughter to a nobleman—imagining it as potentially advantageous—reveals the limited options available to women and the pragmatic calculations that survival sometimes required.</p>

<p>The hamlet where Branwen lives, situated near the sacred site of Londinos, exists at a crossroads of the Celtic world—between the territories of different tribes, at the meeting point of river and sea, where druids perform ancient rituals and great chiefs pass through on their way to battle. This liminal space, neither fully wild nor civilized, reflects the transitional moment in British history that Branwen witnesses.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Branwen embodies several important themes in the novel. Her fierce independence and ungovernable temper represent the spirit of the Celtic people—passionate, brave, and resistant to control. Her confrontation with the wolf, where she weaponizes her own rage to survive, serves as a metaphor for the Celtic resistance to Rome: outnumbered and outmatched, but refusing to yield, using whatever weapons are available.</p>

<p>She also represents innocence caught in the currents of history and adult machinations. Unaware that she has been bargained away, playing in the meadows while armies mass for battle, she symbolizes all the ordinary lives disrupted by the grand movements of empire and war. The fact that she is ultimately not delivered to the captain—saved not by her mother's plan but by her father's honor—suggests the unpredictability of fate and the limits of human control.</p>

<p>Her fair hair and bright blue eyes, which make her noticeable to the noble, also mark her as representative of Celtic Britain itself—young, beautiful, and vulnerable to the desires of more powerful forces. That she survives and continues living by the river after the battle, with her brother and mother, suggests the resilience of the British people even after military defeat.</p>

<p>Finally, Branwen's relationship with her brother Segovax connects her to the ongoing story of this place. While Segovax is told by the druid that "the river is your father now," Branwen too is a child of the river, shaped by its tidal breathing and destined to continue the family line in this landscape that will one day become London.</p>
