<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Fleming is a minor tradesman who operates a stall near the Charterhouse monastery with his wife, selling religious items such as crucifixes, rosaries, and brightly painted plaster figures. His business is destroyed by the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538, leaving him dependent on his brother-in-law Dan Dogget's support.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Fleming is of medium height with a rather concave face. His wife is described as tall as he is and stout.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Fleming appears to be a passive figure dominated by his more assertive wife. He is characterized primarily by his economic vulnerability and dependence on others. While his wife freely expresses her opinions and expectations, Fleming seems more uncertain, as shown when he questions whether Dan Dogget will actually help them. His occupation suggests he was willing to profit from religious commerce without necessarily being deeply pious himself, though the text provides no insight into his actual religious convictions.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1533-will-doggets-placement'>1533: Will Dogget's Placement</h3>

<p>Fleming and his wife appear in a procession led by Thomas Meredith to place Will Dogget, Fleming's father-in-law, in the care of the Charterhouse monks. The couple had been tending their profitable stall selling religious items near the monastery. Mistress Fleming heaps praises upon the courtier and monks for their kindness to her father, though this is noted as somewhat hypocritical since she herself had refused to take any interest in the old man for more than five years.</p>

<h3 id='1538-the-dissolution'>1538: The Dissolution</h3>

<p>By May 1538, Fleming and his wife face financial ruin. They look glumly across their stall as they prepare to close their business for the last time. The Dissolution of the Monasteries has eliminated their customer base and made their inventory of religious trinkets and images obsolete, as such items are now condemned by the reformers.</p>

<p>As they pack up their stall for the last time, Mistress Fleming laments that "Our occupation's gone." They wheel their handcart down into Smithfield where they witness the brutal execution of Doctor Forest, an elderly priest who had been confessor to Queen Katherine. The old man is dangled in chains over a fire in a prolonged torture, though the crowd eventually knocks down the scaffolding to end his suffering quickly.</p>

<p>After witnessing this horrific scene, Mistress Fleming declares it is fortunate that her brother Daniel makes good money on the royal barge and will have to support them now. When Fleming questions whether Dan will actually help them, she insists "He's family, isn't he?" Just then, they hear thunder.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='mistress-fleming'>Mistress Fleming</h3>

<p>Fleming's wife is the more dominant personality in their marriage. She is taller and stouter than he is, more vocal, and more confident in making claims on family obligations. She had neglected her own father for over five years but shows no shame in praising others for their care of him. She is quick to declare that her brother Dan must support them after their business fails.</p>

<h3 id='dan-dogget'>Dan Dogget</h3>

<p>Fleming's relationship with his brother-in-law Dan Dogget is mediated entirely through his wife. Fleming expresses doubt about whether Dan will actually help them, while his wife confidently asserts that family obligation will ensure their support. Dan is already burdened with many obligations, including his own wife and children, his sister's family, and his difficult father Will Dogget. Fleming and his wife's additional dependence adds to Dan's financial pressures.</p>

<h3 id='will-dogget'>Will Dogget</h3>

<p>Fleming's father-in-law, who the Flemings had allowed to be placed in the Charterhouse after refusing to care for him themselves for over five years.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Fleming's story illustrates the economic disruption caused by the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536-1541). Under Thomas Cromwell's direction as Henry VIII's Vicegerent, monasteries throughout England were closed and their assets seized by the Crown. This had far-reaching consequences beyond the religious houses themselves.</p>

<p>The Flemings represent a class of tradespeople whose livelihoods depended on the medieval Catholic religious economy. Monasteries generated demand for religious articles, pilgrimage items, and devotional objects. The stall holders who sold crucifixes, rosaries, saints' images, and other religious trinkets outside monastery gates suddenly found their entire business model obsolete. The religious trinkets they sold were now condemned by reformers as idolatrous, and their customer base had literally been dissolved.</p>

<p>The text notes that Cromwell and civic authorities acknowledged that monasteries had provided essential social services—housing the elderly and poor, feeding the hungry at their doors. The Dissolution created a crisis of beggars and displaced people that parishes struggled to manage. Fleming and his wife are part of this larger wave of economic casualties.</p>

<p>Their witness of Doctor Forest's execution at Smithfield exemplifies the brutal enforcement of religious change. Forest, in his eighties, had been Queen Katherine's confessor and was burned for his refusal to accept the new religious order. The crowd's intervention to end his suffering quickly suggests popular unease with the cruelty of these reforms, even as people like Fleming had no choice but to adapt or perish economically.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Fleming represents the economic casualties of religious and political upheaval. His story demonstrates how sweeping historical changes—the English Reformation and the Dissolution of the Monasteries—destroyed individual livelihoods and forced ordinary people into dependence and poverty. He is one of many "stall holders" mentioned who "trafficked before the gates of every London monastery" and were left with nothing when religious reform eliminated their trade.</p>

<p>The character also illustrates the strain that such crises placed on family networks. Dan Dogget, already stretched thin by multiple obligations, faces yet another claim on his resources from his sister and her husband. Fleming's doubt about whether Dan will actually help them hints at the fragility of these family safety nets when economic disaster struck entire classes of people simultaneously.</p>

<p>Fleming's passive characterization—defined more by what happens to him than by his actions—emphasizes the powerlessness of ordinary people caught in the tide of historical change driven by monarchs, ministers, and religious conflicts far beyond their control or understanding.</p>
