<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Harry Dogget is a proud cockney costermonger operating in Seven Dials during the Georgian era, a man of medium build but formidable reputation who makes his living selling fish, fruit, and vegetables from his painted barrow. Despite the constant drain on his modest income caused by his wife's gin addiction, Harry maintains his standing as a respected figure in the working-class community and proves himself capable of extraordinary kindness, most notably when he takes in an abandoned baby with webbed hands and a white streak in his hair—a child he believes is his own illegitimate son but who turns out, ironically, to be the heir to an earldom.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Harry Dogget is described as "medium-sized but very square," with a build that belies his strength—a butcher who once provoked him said he'd "rather be kicked by a dray-horse" than experience another of Harry's punches. He habitually wears a red kerchief tied loosely round his neck, a distinctive marker of his trade and personality. The text notes that the webbed fingers characteristic of his family "had skipped Harry Dogget" but were passed down from his father to his grandchildren. He wears a cap on his head when working and leather gloves when pushing his barrow.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Harry Dogget embodies the wit, resilience, and practical wisdom of the Georgian London cockney. He is fiercely proud of his cockney identity and delights in teaching his children the rhyming slang that marks their culture—"Holy Friar" for liar, "Trouble and Strife" for wife, "Needle and Pin" for gin. Despite financial struggles caused by Mrs Dogget's drinking, he maintains a remarkably even temperament, treating his wife with affection and patience rather than anger.</p>

<p>His moral character is fundamentally decent. When he discovers an abandoned baby with the same webbed hands and white-streaked hair as his week-old son Sam, he immediately takes the child home, reasoning that he couldn't "leave him to die." His honesty extends even to this situation—he tells his wife "everything, very straight" about his suspicion that the foundling is his illegitimate child from a brief affair.</p>

<p>Harry is respected in Seven Dials not just for his physical strength but for his fairness and good humor. He's known to be "fair in his dealings, the first to crack or to see a joke, generally liked – and by the women too, it was well known." This last detail hints at occasional infidelities, which he views with characteristic pragmatism, noting that his wife "might not be guiltless in that respect herself."</p>

<p>As a father, Harry is practical rather than sentimental. He teaches his children to "look sharp" and "look after yourselves," recognizing that in their precarious economic position, self-reliance is essential. Yet he also encourages Sep's dreams of becoming a waterman and fireman, seeing it as "a pretty fair one" and noting "they make good money too."</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='c-1710-1742-early-life-and-marriage'>c. 1710-1742: Early Life and Marriage</h3>

<p>Harry Dogget grew up in the Seven Dials area of London, learning the costermonger's trade. By 1750, he owns his own "splendidly painted barrow" and donkey, marking him as established in his profession. Though "just below" the ultimate elite of costermongers who rule each area like "cockney monarchies," Harry is "not a person to be trifled with."</p>

<p>He married Mrs Dogget at some point and had several children. Their eldest son was designated to inherit the barrow and help with the business, while their daughters went into domestic service or kept house. The marriage, while affectionate on Harry's part, was plagued by Mrs Dogget's addiction to gin, which prevented her from contributing to the family income and kept them perpetually struggling financially.</p>

<h3 id='1743-the-foundling'>1743: The Foundling</h3>

<p>A week after his wife gave birth to Sam, Harry discovered an abandoned baby by the pillar at Seven Dials. The infant had a distinctive white streak in his hair and webbed fingers—exactly like newborn Sam. Harry immediately suspected the child was his own, the result of an affair with "the young woman he had met in the fruit and flower market in Covent Garden" about ten months earlier, who had subsequently vanished.</p>

<p>Rather than leave the baby to die, Harry brought him home and confessed everything to his wife. Mrs Dogget, demonstrating remarkable tolerance (possibly due to her own failings with gin), accepted the situation with humor: "I must've had twins, Harry. Just never noticed." The vicar who baptized the boy suggested the name Septimus (Latin for "Seventh") because he was found by Seven Dials, which the household quickly shortened to Sep. Harry reflected that "the incident only sealed for ever the affection he had for her."</p>

<h3 id='c-1743-1750-family-life-in-seven-dials'>c. 1743-1750: Family Life in Seven Dials</h3>

<p>Harry continued his costermonger's trade, operating from Seven Dials and nearby areas. He encouraged Sep's interest in becoming a waterman, even telling him the Dogget's Coat and Badge race was named after "my old Uncle Tom"—a lie Harry told purely to see "the little boy flush with pride," having "not the faintest idea" if Thomas Dogget was actually related to their family.</p>

<p>The family's finances remained tight due to Mrs Dogget's drinking. Harry tried various solutions: taking her to work in the market gardens at Chelsea and Fulham (she "still managed to find gin, become drunk and smashed into a greenhouse"), and suggesting she join the hop-picking at the Bocton estate in Kent (she "refused to go"). He philosophically concluded: "Some get driven to drink. She just took to it."</p>

<p>Despite these struggles, Harry maintained his authority and reputation in the area. Sam and Sep, at age seven, were known and protected by the community precisely because "their father was Harry Dogget: a man of some importance."</p>

<h3 id='may-1750-the-discovery'>May 1750: The Discovery</h3>

<p>When Sep (actually Sam) was caught stealing in the grand house at 17 Hanover Square, Captain Jack Meredith brought the boy to Harry at Covent Garden, where the costermonger was working his barrow "with a cap on his head" and "leather gloves." Initially defensive of his boy—"Never. 'E'd never do such a thing"—Harry listened as Meredith explained his suspicions about the child's origins.</p>

<p>Harry told the captain exactly how he'd found the baby at Seven Dials, noting the webbed hands and white-streaked hair. When Meredith confirmed this was the missing child and asked if Harry would give him up, the costermonger showed his practical wisdom and genuine care for the boy's welfare. Rather than simply hand him over, Harry insisted on seeing the house first and getting assurance that the boy would "live 'ere, not a servant, like, but one o' the family." When told yes, "he shook his head in wonderment" and asked if he could "come back tomorrow to see 'im? Just to make sure 'e's all right."</p>

<h3 id='the-final-conversation'>The Final Conversation</h3>

<p>The next day, Harry met with the boy (actually Sam) at the corner of Hanover Square. In a conversation that reveals both Harry's pragmatism and his genuine affection, he addressed Sam's confusion about his identity with characteristic logic and humor.</p>

<p>When Sam worried about whether he or Sep was truly Harry's son, the costermonger responded: "When I found him, I reckoned he was mine. They lost one like him, so they say. Come to think of it, maybe he don't really belong to neither of us. But it don't signify now." What mattered to Harry was the practical outcome: "you, my son, have just got a bit of a leg up in the world."</p>

<p>When Sam confessed "I'm a lord," Harry "laughed so hard that he had to hold on to a nearby railing." He firmly advised the boy to accept his fortune: "Use your loaf. You want to live all your life in the bread and butter? Look at this 'ouse. 'Er ladyship says you're 'er Bath bun. You'd better keep quiet and be glad of it." He even threatened: "if you give this lot up I'll take a strap to your backside till you'll wish you was a lord again."</p>

<p>Before parting, Harry agreed to give Sep Sam's savings, and "went off, whistling a merry tune."</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='mrs-dogget'>Mrs Dogget</h3>

<p>Harry's relationship with his wife is marked by patience, affection, and pragmatic acceptance. Despite her gin addiction—she could drink through a shilling in a day and was "flushed bright red" much of the time—Harry treats her with consistent kindness. He calls her "my Trouble and Strife" (rhyming slang for wife) and tells her affectionately, "You're a good old girl. That's what you are."</p>

<p>Harry has tried various schemes to help her overcome her addiction, all unsuccessful, but he never becomes bitter or cruel. When he brought home the foundling Sep, admitting his probable infidelity, Mrs Dogget's acceptance of the situation only deepened his love for her. The narrative notes that "the incident only sealed for ever the affection he had for her."</p>

<p>He views her drinking philosophically rather than moralistically: "Some get driven to drink. She just took to it." While he occasionally wonders if his "other women" might have driven her to drink, "he didn't think so," noting that "she might not be guiltless in that respect herself."</p>

<h3 id='sam-and-sep'>Sam and Sep</h3>

<p>Harry treats both boys equally as his sons, never showing favoritism despite knowing Sep is probably not his biological child. He encourages their different ambitions—the eldest son will inherit the barrow, Sam wants to be a costermonger with his own barrow, and Sep dreams of being a waterman and fireman.</p>

<p>He teaches them cockney rhyming slang and practical wisdom, warning them to "look sharp" and "learn to look after yourselves" given the family's precarious finances. When Sep expresses interest in the watermen, Harry actively encourages him, explaining the opportunities in firefighting and noting "they make good money too."</p>

<p>When confronted with having to give up Sam (who he thinks is Sep) to the aristocratic family, Harry demonstrates both pragmatism and genuine concern for the boy's welfare. He insists on seeing the house and confirming the boy will be treated well before agreeing, and he arranges to check on him the next day. His final advice to Sam is practical and loving: take this opportunity for a better life, but "if you get in trouble you know where to find me."</p>

<h3 id='captain-jack-meredith'>Captain Jack Meredith</h3>

<p>Harry's interaction with Meredith shows his ability to read people and situations quickly. When Meredith first approaches with Sep in Covent Garden, Harry is initially defensive but quickly sizes up the captain: "You look a reg'lar gentleman, I'll allow."</p>

<p>After Meredith confirms the boy's identity and Harry sees the house, he whistles in amazement at the scale of the opportunity. He shows deference to Meredith's social position while maintaining his own dignity and ensuring his conditions are met before handing over the child. His request to visit the next day shows both his caution and his genuine care for the boy's welfare.</p>

<h3 id='the-seven-dials-community'>The Seven Dials Community</h3>

<p>Though not detailed in specific relationships, Harry's position in Seven Dials is clearly established. He is a respected figure whose protection extends to his children—even those in the area "whose tempers might be uncertain, or habits dangerous, were unlikely ever to trouble Sam and Sep. After all, their father was Harry Dogget: a man of some importance."</p>

<p>His reputation is built on fairness, strength, and humor. A butcher who once fought him became a cautionary tale in the neighborhood. Harry's red kerchief is a recognizable symbol, and he's known for being "generally liked – and by the women too."</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Harry Dogget represents the Georgian London cockney working class at a time when street-sellers were increasingly important to the city's economy. The expansion of London beyond the old city walls, the conversion of street stalls to permanent shops, and the growing population all created opportunities for costermongers like Harry, who brought goods directly to customers unable or unwilling to enter the new shops.</p>

<p>The costermongers formed an informal hierarchy, with the greatest families passing their positions "down from generation to generation in cockney monarchies." Harry, though "just below this ultimate élite," held significant authority in his area, representing the skilled, established working class rather than the desperately poor.</p>

<p>His life also illustrates the devastating impact of cheap gin on Georgian London's working class. Introduced by Dutch King William, gin became "the greatest curse of the times" with the saying "Drunk for a penny, dead drunk for twopence." Mrs Dogget's addiction exemplifies what they called "Mother's ruin," though in this case it was "family ruin," preventing Harry from ever getting ahead financially despite his hard work and respected position.</p>

<p>The cockney culture Harry embodies—with its rhyming slang, pride in identity defined by being born within sound of Bow bells, and rich linguistic playfulness—represents the distinctive working-class culture of London that drew on centuries of diverse influences: "old English, Viking, Norman French, Italian, Flemish, Welsh, God knows what else besides."</p>

<p>Harry's story also highlights the fluid nature of family and identity in working-class Georgian London. Abandoned babies were tragically common in places like Seven Dials, where "hardly one newborn baby in three lived to the age of six." The foundling hospital established by Captain Coram could only accept children by lottery, such was the demand. Harry's immediate rescue of Sep, and his wife's acceptance of him, show both the harsh realities and the human kindness that coexisted in this world.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Harry Dogget embodies the resilience, wit, and essential decency of London's working class. His story explores several interconnected themes:</p>

<p><strong>Identity and Parenthood</strong>: The central irony of Harry's story is that he raises as his own son the very child who is actually the rightful Earl of St James, while his biological son Sep remains unknown to him. Yet Harry's philosophy that "it don't signify" whether Sep belongs to him or not makes a powerful statement about what constitutes true parenthood. His immediate rescue of the abandoned baby and his wife's acceptance demonstrate that family can be made through love and commitment rather than merely blood.</p>

<p><strong>Social Mobility and Chance</strong>: Harry's final conversation with Sam illustrates the arbitrary nature of social position. One boy becomes an earl purely by chance—by being the one caught stealing—while his twin brother remains a working-class boy. Harry, rather than being bitter about this arbitrary division, pragmatically encourages Sam to seize the opportunity: "you, my son, have just got a bit of a leg up in the world."</p>

<p><strong>Working-Class Dignity</strong>: Despite economic struggles and his wife's addiction, Harry maintains his dignity, authority, and reputation. He is neither idealized as noble nor caricatured as degraded, but presented as a fully realized human being with strengths, weaknesses, and a moral compass rooted in practical wisdom rather than abstract principles.</p>

<p><strong>Cockney Culture</strong>: Harry serves as an exemplar of London cockney identity—the pride in being born within the sound of Bow bells, the linguistic playfulness of rhyming slang, the sharp wit, and the cultural continuity stretching back generations. He actively transmits this culture to his children, teaching them the verbal games that mark their identity.</p>

<p><strong>Marriage and Acceptance</strong>: Harry's relationship with Mrs Dogget, despite its challenges, demonstrates a form of working-class marriage based on pragmatic acceptance rather than romantic ideals. His patience with her addiction, his admission of probable infidelity, and their mutual tolerance create a bond that, while far from ideal, proves durable and affectionate.</p>

<p><strong>The Contrast Between Classes</strong>: Harry's brief intersection with the aristocratic world of Lady St James illuminates the vast gulf between classes. Yet he navigates this encounter with dignity, insisting on his conditions before surrendering the boy and maintaining his right to verify the child's welfare. He neither grovels nor rebels, but maintains his own sense of self-worth while recognizing the practical advantages of the aristocratic life for Sam.</p>

<p>Harry Dogget ultimately represents the "common Londoner" who, despite limited means and personal struggles, maintains decency, humor, and resilience. His legacy is not wealth or status but the values he imparts to his children and the genuine love he shows to all of them, whether born to him or found by chance at Seven Dials.</p>
