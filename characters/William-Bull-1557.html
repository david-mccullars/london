<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>William Bull is a prosperous brewer in Elizabethan London, ten years older than his fashionable cousin <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a>. Though he works in the family brewery alongside his brothers, he finds the trade dull and is easily flattered into investing fifty pounds in the Blackfriars Theatre venture, hoping for both excitement and profit. His earnest, anxious nature contrasts sharply with Edmund's flamboyant style, and despite being a cautious businessman, his desire to be part of the glamorous theatrical world leads him to trust his cousin's assurances about the investment.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>No physical description provided in the text.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>William Bull is characterized by his stolid, earnest demeanor and his tendency toward anxiety. Though ten years Edmund's senior, he remains "rather in awe of his cousin" because "Edmund had such style." This reveals a fundamental insecurity beneath his merchant success – he is impressed by the fashionable world that Edmund inhabits and yearns for something beyond the prosperous but "dull" brewery business.</p>

<p>He demonstrates a practical businessman's caution, becoming "a little nervous" when rumors arise about the Blackfriars Theatre project, and methodically seeking reassurance about his investment. Yet this prudence is undermined by his susceptibility to flattery and his desire for excitement. When Edmund approaches him with the investment opportunity, Bull is "flattered" that his stylish young cousin would include him in such a venture.</p>

<p>His interactions with Edmund reveal a man who wants to assert himself as a creditor but lacks the confidence to do so effectively. He comes repeatedly to ask about his fifty pounds, "anxious" and determined to see the Burbages himself, yet is easily talked out of it by Edmund's persuasive arguments. His tendency to depart "shaking his head" suggests he recognizes he is being put off, but his awe of Edmund and his hope that the investment will succeed prevent him from taking firmer action.</p>

<p>William's character embodies the respectable merchant who dreams of participating in more glamorous pursuits but lacks both the sophistication and the assertiveness to navigate that world successfully. He is fundamentally decent and earnest, not equipped to see through Edmund's deceptions.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1597-the-blackfriars-investment'>1597: The Blackfriars Investment</h3>

<p>In early 1597, William Bull was approached by his cousin <a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a> with what seemed an exciting opportunity. Edmund had connections with the Burbage brothers, who were fitting up an elegant indoor theatre in the Blackfriars precinct. The project was ambitious and expensive – the lease and refurbishments came to a staggering six hundred pounds.</p>

<p>William found the brewery business "prosperous but dull" and felt his brothers "never seemed to let him do much." When Edmund offered to include him in the theatrical venture, Bull was flattered and intrigued. He lent Edmund fifty pounds, which Edmund combined with five pounds of his own and then lent the entire sum to the Burbages in his own name alone, making himself appear a more substantial investor than he actually was.</p>

<p>Edmund sweetened the deal by proudly telling William that he had been commissioned to write a play for the new theatre, making Bull "doubly proud" – proud both of the investment and of his cousin's literary achievements.</p>

<h3 id='spring-summer-1597-growing-anxiety'>Spring-Summer 1597: Growing Anxiety</h3>

<p>William's initial enthusiasm began to give way to nervousness as problems emerged. When old Burbage died that winter, Bull had some concern, though he was reassured that the two Burbage sons were carrying on normally. More troubling was the rumor that residents of Blackfriars, led by Alderman Ducket, were petitioning to stop the theatre from opening. Ducket condemned all theatres as encouraging "disorder and Godlessness" and threatened to shut them down.</p>

<p>One morning, William waited "for some time" before Edmund arrived to show him the theatre. Despite his worries – which he tried not to show – Bull was "impressed" by the elegant hall with its classical pillars and decorated stage. When Edmund assured him "We shall all make a fortune" and promised the theatre would open before year's end, Bull gave "a sigh of relief" and looked forward to getting his money back.</p>

<h3 id='summer-1597-the-privy-council-order'>Summer 1597: The Privy Council Order</h3>

<p>The situation deteriorated dramatically when the Privy Council, responding to the Blackfriars residents' petition, ordered that no plays could be performed in the precinct. The Blackfriars Theatre project was suddenly in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Three days after this announcement, an "anxious" William came to Edmund's lodgings at the Staple Inn to ask about his fifty pounds. Edmund counselled him to "Keep calm" and assured him "This will pass." Bull departed "shaking his head," clearly unconvinced but unable to push harder against his persuasive cousin.</p>

<p>The following day, when William encountered Edmund again and asked how matters stood, Edmund – whose mistress had just cheated him and whose play seemed lost – could not bear to face his cousin. He "muttering quickly that all was well" hurried "away in cowardly flight," leaving William with no real answers.</p>

<h3 id='late-summer-1597-the-globe-solution'>Late Summer 1597: The Globe Solution</h3>

<p>The Chamberlain's Men found a solution to their crisis. They secretly dismantled their Theatre in Shoreditch and transported the timbers across the Thames to Bankside, where they built a new open-air playhouse called the Globe. This new venture proceeded rapidly, and by late summer the theatre was nearing completion.</p>

<h3 id='september-1597-final-attempt-to-recover-his-money'>September 1597: Final Attempt to Recover His Money</h3>

<p>More than a week after Edmund had submitted his play to the Burbages, William Bull paid another visit, now more determined. "I think it is time that I see the Burbages myself," he said stolidly. "I want my fifty pounds."</p>

<p>Edmund, desperate because he had never told the Burbages that fifty pounds of his investment came from William, panicked. "But you must not," he cried. Edmund spun an elaborate lie, claiming the Burbages were "splenetic" about paying their debts, that William was not the only creditor, but that Edmund had persuaded them to pay William first. He warned that if William approached them now, just as they were occupied with their first performances, they would be "furious" and would "really make you wait."</p>

<p>William wavered. "You think so?" Edmund was emphatic. Bull finally sighed and agreed to wait. "But I count on you," he said as he prepared to leave. "To the death," Edmund replied "with a relief he could not describe."</p>

<p>The next day, Edmund received word that his play would be performed the following week.</p>

<h3 id='the-performance-and-after'>The Performance and After</h3>

<p>Whether William Bull attended the disastrous first performance of Edmund's play is not recorded in the narrative. The play was poorly received by the audience, and Edmund's situation became even more complicated when <a href="characters/Jane-Fleming-1583.html">Jane Fleming</a> was kidnapped by <a href="characters/Orlando-Black-Barnikel-1562.html">Orlando Black Barnikel</a> immediately afterward.</p>

<p>The text does not reveal whether William ever recovered his fifty pounds or what became of his relationship with Edmund after the theatrical venture's failure.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='edmund-meredithedmund-meredith-1575html'><a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a></h3>

<p>William's relationship with his younger cousin is defined by a mixture of family affection, financial entanglement, and an unfortunate power imbalance. Despite being ten years Edmund's senior and presumably more established in business, William is "rather in awe" of Edmund because of his cousin's style and sophistication.</p>

<p>This admiration makes William vulnerable to Edmund's manipulation. When Edmund needs money, he knows exactly how to appeal to his older cousin – by offering him entry into the exciting theatrical world and by flattering him with inclusion in an opportunity that requires insider connections. William is "flattered" by Edmund's approach and "doubly proud" when told Edmund has been commissioned to write a play.</p>

<p>As the investment sours, William attempts to assert himself as a creditor, but Edmund repeatedly deflects him with persuasive arguments and outright lies. William's repeated visits – becoming progressively more "anxious" and determined – show both his persistence and his fundamental inability to overcome his awe of Edmund. He leaves each meeting "shaking his head," recognizing on some level that he is being managed, yet unable to break through Edmund's confident assurances.</p>

<p>The relationship reveals the social dynamics of Elizabethan London, where style and education trumped wealth and age. William has money, but Edmund has connections, wit, and the confidence of someone educated at the Inns of Court. William can never quite overcome the sense that Edmund moves in a more glamorous sphere.</p>

<h3 id='his-brothers'>His Brothers</h3>

<p>William's brothers remain unnamed in the narrative, but their relationship with him is significant. The brewery is "prosperous," suggesting the Bulls are successful merchants, but William feels his brothers "never seemed to let him do much." This suggests he occupies a subordinate position in the family business, perhaps as a younger brother or simply as someone not trusted with major decisions.</p>

<p>This frustration with his limited role in the brewery helps explain why William was so easily drawn into Edmund's scheme. The theatrical investment offered not just financial return but also autonomy and importance – a chance to be the one making decisions and taking risks, rather than following his brothers' lead.</p>

<h3 id='the-burbages'>The Burbages</h3>

<p>William has no direct relationship with the Burbage brothers, the theatre operators who actually received his money. Edmund deliberately kept William at arm's length from the Burbages, presenting the entire fifty-five pounds as his own investment. When William finally proposes to see the Burbages directly, Edmund prevents it through manipulation, knowing that such a meeting would expose his deception.</p>

<p>This absence of direct relationship is crucial to William's misfortune. He has invested in a business venture with people he has never met, relying entirely on Edmund as intermediary – a recipe for exploitation.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>William Bull represents the prosperous merchant class of Elizabethan London, specifically the brewers who supplied one of the city's essential commodities. Brewing was a substantial and respectable trade in Tudor London, where clean drinking water was often unavailable and beer was consumed by all classes as a safe alternative.</p>

<p>The Bull family's success in brewing places them in the upper ranks of London's merchant class – prosperous enough to have capital to invest, but not part of the gentry or aristocracy. This social position creates the dynamic visible in William's character: he is secure in his wealth but insecure about his social standing, conscious that men like Edmund with legal education and courtly connections occupy a higher cultural sphere.</p>

<p>William's investment in the Blackfriars Theatre venture reflects a broader phenomenon of Elizabethan England. The theatre was becoming increasingly fashionable, and wealthy merchants sought association with it both for financial gain and social prestige. The Blackfriars project was particularly attractive because it was an indoor theatre in a respectable precinct, aimed at a wealthier audience than the public playhouses. For someone like William, it represented an investment in culture and sophistication, not just commerce.</p>

<p>The failure of the Blackfriars project due to the Privy Council's intervention illustrates the precarious position of Elizabethan theatre, always vulnerable to charges of immorality and disorder. The residents of Blackfriars – genteel householders in a former monastic precinct – successfully argued that a public theatre would bring noise, crowds, and moral corruption to their neighborhood. This tension between theatre as art and theatre as public nuisance would persist throughout the period.</p>

<p>The rapid construction of the Globe Theatre on Bankside, using timbers from the dismantled Theatre in Shoreditch, shows the entrepreneurial resilience of the Elizabethan theatre business. When blocked in one location, the players simply moved to another jurisdiction. For investors like William, however, these dramatic pivots meant uncertainty about whether and when they would see returns on their capital.</p>

<p>William's story also reflects the importance of personal connections in Elizabethan business. Formal contracts and legal protections existed, but much business was still conducted through family networks and personal trust. William invests because Edmund is his cousin and because he trusts family connection. This makes him vulnerable when Edmund prioritizes his own interests over family loyalty.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>William Bull embodies several important themes in the novel's portrayal of Elizabethan London.</p>

<p>Most prominently, he represents the collision between commerce and culture. The Bulls have prospered through trade – the unglamorous work of brewing beer. William has capital but no cultural prestige. The theatre offers a bridge between these worlds, a chance for money to buy entry into the fashionable realm of poetry, plays, and courtly sophistication. His eagerness to invest fifty pounds – a very substantial sum – reflects the social aspirations of London's merchant class, who sought to translate economic success into cultural status.</p>

<p>William also illustrates the vulnerability of the earnest and straightforward in a world of sophisticated manipulation. His stolid, honest character cannot match Edmund's quick wit and persuasive tongue. He knows he is being managed but lacks the tools to break through Edmund's deceptions. This dynamic appears repeatedly in Rutherford's novel: the contrast between different kinds of intelligence and power, where education and style can triumph over age, experience, and wealth.</p>

<p>The character highlights the importance of family networks in Elizabethan commerce and their potential for abuse. William invests because Edmund is family – this should make the investment safer, but actually makes it more dangerous because family connection makes William reluctant to push too hard for his money. Edmund exploits the very relationship that should have protected William's interests.</p>

<p>William's subordinate position in his own family business – his brothers never letting him "do much" – speaks to the hierarchies within merchant families and the frustrations of younger or less assertive members. His attempt to break free through the theatrical investment ends in likely financial loss, suggesting the risks of stepping outside one's proper sphere.</p>

<p>Finally, William serves as a minor victim in Edmund's story arc. Edmund's grand ambitions and questionable ethics create collateral damage. William risks fifty pounds he can probably afford to lose, but the betrayal of trust is more significant than the money. The repeated scenes of William seeking assurance and Edmund deflecting him build a sense of guilt that shadows Edmund's pursuit of literary glory. Even as Edmund achieves his goal of having a play performed, he does so while systematically deceiving a family member who trusted him.</p>

<p>William Bull's story, though occupying a relatively small space in the chapter, efficiently conveys the social dynamics, commercial relationships, and ethical compromises of Elizabethan London. He is the unglamorous cousin, practical but credulous, whose capital flows toward art and excitement, likely never to return.</p>
