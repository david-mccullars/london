<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Will Dogget is an aging waterman and the father of <a href="characters/Dan-Dogget-1510.html">Dan Dogget</a>, a king's waterman. A cheerful but irresponsible drunk known for his carefree attitude and disregard for authority, Will becomes a burden to his son who struggles to care for him. His transformation occurs when he is placed in the Charterhouse monastery and forms a devoted attachment to Father <a href="characters/Peter-Meredith-1488.html">Peter Meredith</a>, ultimately demonstrating unexpected loyalty and faithfulness that contrasts sharply with his earlier dissolute behavior.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Will Dogget is somewhat stooped by age, though he would be as tall as his son <a href="characters/Dan-Dogget-1510.html">Dan</a> (six foot three) if he stood upright. He has a long grey beard that is kept brushed. Despite being dressed in clean clothes, there is something vaguely disreputable about his walk that suggests a lifetime of cheerfully doing as he liked and a readiness to veer off in pursuit of pleasure at any moment.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Will Dogget embodies "cheerful anarchy" – a man who has spent his entire life doing exactly as he pleased without concern for consequences or authority. His personality is defined by good nature, humor, and an utter inability to control his appetites, particularly for drink. He is described as "a standing joke to his friends" and possesses an habitually cheerful manner even when being admonished by his son.</p>

<p>Despite his many faults, Will is not malicious or deliberately difficult. The prior of the Charterhouse observes that he is "not a bad soul," just fundamentally unsuited to discipline or restriction. His drunken escapades are legendary – he is described as "memorable" even in his cups, capable of singing waterman's ditties with language that shocks even monks who have seen much of life.</p>

<p>What makes Will's character fascinating is his capacity for transformation. When Father <a href="characters/Peter-Meredith-1488.html">Peter Meredith</a> arrives at the Charterhouse, Will attaches himself to the priest and undergoes what Dan calls "the most remarkable thing I've ever seen" – a complete reformation of his behavior. This suggests that beneath the dissolute exterior lies a capacity for devotion and loyalty that simply needed the right object.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='c-1485-1533-life-as-a-waterman'>c. 1485-1533: Life as a Waterman</h3>

<p>Will Dogget spent his life working as a waterman on the Thames, the same profession his son <a href="characters/Dan-Dogget-1510.html">Dan</a> would follow. His approach to life was characterized by cheerful irresponsibility and frequent drinking, earning him a reputation among the watermen of London. He passed down to Dan not only his impressive height but also his love of the waterman's life and, unfortunately, his difficulty with authority and discipline.</p>

<h3 id='1533-becoming-a-burden'>1533: Becoming a Burden</h3>

<p>By 1533, Will has been living with his son Dan and Dan's family in Southwark for a year – "a year that he had regretted it," as Dan puts it. Will's "last drunken escapade" has pushed Dan to the breaking point: "I can't handle him any more." Dan's sister has refused to take the old man in, leaving Dan in a difficult position. He cannot simply throw his father out, yet keeping him is becoming impossible.</p>

<p>The problem is not just Will's drinking but his complete inability to conform to any expectations or discipline. Dan needs money to resolve the situation, which becomes one of his motivations for seeking a position as a king's waterman through <a href="characters/Thomas-Meredith-1507.html">Thomas Meredith</a>.</p>

<h3 id='may-1535-placement-at-the-charterhouse'>May 1535: Placement at the Charterhouse</h3>

<p>Through Thomas Meredith's intervention, Will is admitted to the Charterhouse monastery as a dependant – one of the many poor or aged people housed and cared for by religious orders. He is given a cell to share with two other old men and assigned to work in the garden.</p>

<p>When Dan delivers him to the monastery, he warns: "You're to behave yourself, now. If you get thrown out of here, that's it. I'm not taking you back." Will listens with his habitual cheerful smile, but Dan's parting comment to his sister reveals his doubts: "Though God knows how long he'll last."</p>

<h3 id='the-drunken-incident'>The Drunken Incident</h3>

<p>Will's reformation does not occur immediately. Soon after arriving at the Charterhouse, he goes to a local tavern, makes acquaintances who buy him drinks, and proceeds to drink his way through multiple establishments for hours – consuming "far more than he had done for many months."</p>

<p>Returning after dark to find the monastery gates closed, Will responds by attempting to break them down with good-natured banging. When a perturbed young monk finally opens the gate, Will walks over to a nut tree in the yard, sits down with his back to it, and treats the monks to "a few verses of a waterman's ditty the language of which had certainly never been heard in the Charterhouse before."</p>

<p>The incident becomes legendary among the younger monks. The sub-prior declares "We cannot have this," and Will would have been ejected immediately if his daughter had not pleaded his case. Dan is summoned from his duties as a king's waterman to deal with the crisis.</p>

<p>The prior offers one final chance: Will may remain only if he stays within the monastery gates. Dan, looking at his father's face, "didn't rate the chances highly."</p>

<h3 id='1535-the-transformation'>1535: The Transformation</h3>

<p>Everything changes when Father <a href="characters/Peter-Meredith-1488.html">Peter Meredith</a> arrives at the Charterhouse. Within a week, Will has "attached himself to the priest" and undergoes a remarkable transformation. No one can explain exactly how Peter accomplished this – "perhaps it was his spiritual influence, or perhaps he just kept the old man company" – but as long as Father Peter is around, Will "seems perfectly happy."</p>

<p>This reformation proves genuine and lasting. Will becomes Peter's faithful attendant, bringing visitors to his cell and tending to him when he becomes ill. The depth of Will's devotion is evident in his behavior: even when the other monks shun the disgraced Peter Meredith (who has refused to take the oath of supremacy and is awaiting punishment), Will continues to treat him with reverence, kneeling to kiss his hand.</p>

<h3 id='june-1535-the-substitution-plot'>June 1535: The Substitution Plot</h3>

<p>Will's loyalty to Peter Meredith proves crucial in a dangerous conspiracy. When <a href="characters/Thomas-Meredith-1507.html">Thomas Meredith</a> orchestrates a plan to save his brother Peter from execution by substituting <a href="characters/Rowland-Bull-1503.html">Rowland Bull</a> in his place, Will plays a vital role. Thomas later explains that "Will Dogget did it because Peter asked, and the old man loved him."</p>

<p>Will's participation in this plot is remarkable given his earlier character – it requires discipline, secrecy, and willingness to risk his life. That he does so demonstrates the profound change Peter Meredith has wrought in him.</p>

<h3 id='june-1536-departure'>June 1536: Departure</h3>

<p>When the authorities finally decide to move the supposedly cowardly and frail "Father Peter Meredith" (actually Rowland Bull in disguise) to another religious house in the north, Will accompanies him. The departure is "hardly even noticed" – a minor administrative matter in the midst of the dissolution of the monasteries.</p>

<p>Will's ultimate fate is unknown, but his willingness to leave the Charterhouse and continue attending to the man he believes to be Peter Meredith demonstrates that his transformation was complete and permanent.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='dan-doggetdan-dogget-1510html'><a href="characters/Dan-Dogget-1510.html">Dan Dogget</a></h3>

<p>The relationship between Will and his son is complex and strained. Dan has inherited his father's impressive physical stature and love of the waterman's life, but also his difficulty with discipline – Dan recognizes in himself "the cheerful anarchy of his father" and acknowledges "I suppose I'm more like him than I thought."</p>

<p>However, Dan has responsibilities – a wife, children, and ambitions for social advancement – that his father never accepted. Will's year living with Dan's family has been difficult, and Dan's frustration is evident: "I can't handle him any more." Yet Dan cannot simply abandon his father; filial duty requires him to find some solution, and his guilt and responsibility drive much of his interaction with <a href="characters/Thomas-Meredith-1507.html">Thomas Meredith</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the exasperation, there is affection beneath Dan's complaints. He goes to considerable effort to secure his father a place at the Charterhouse, and he shows concern for the old man's well-being even while doubting his ability to reform.</p>

<h3 id='father-peter-meredithpeter-meredith-1488html'>Father <a href="characters/Peter-Meredith-1488.html">Peter Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Will's attachment to Peter Meredith is the defining relationship of his later life and the catalyst for his transformation. The nature of their bond is somewhat mysterious – the text suggests it might be Peter's spiritual influence or simply his companionship – but the result is undeniable.</p>

<p>Will becomes Peter's devoted attendant, serving him faithfully and treating him with reverence. When Peter is disgraced for refusing the oath of supremacy and the other monks shun him, Will's loyalty never wavers. He tends Peter in his illness, brings visitors to his cell, and shows him such devotion that he kneels to kiss Peter's hand even in the midst of the Charterhouse courtyard where the monks look away.</p>

<p>Most remarkably, Will's love for Peter leads him to participate in a dangerous conspiracy to save the priest's life, risking execution himself. This loyalty continues even after they leave the Charterhouse together, with Will accompanying the man he believes to be Peter to an unknown fate in the north.</p>

<h3 id='sister-doggetsister-dogget-1505html'><a href="characters/Sister-Dogget-1505.html">Sister Dogget</a></h3>

<p>Will's relationship with his daughter is distant and strained. She is described as "aggressive" in manner and runs a business selling religious images. When Dan needs help caring for their father, she flatly refuses: "she wouldn't take him."</p>

<p>When the Charterhouse threatens to eject Will after his drunken incident, she appears and "heap[s] praises upon the courtier, and the monks, for their wonderful kindness to her father" – but the text notes this is "no doubt in order since she herself, for more than five years, had refused to take any interest in the old man." Her piety appears performative, and her relationship with Will is characterized by avoidance and obligation rather than affection.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Will Dogget represents the watermen of Tudor London, a proud and distinct working-class profession. The watermen were the city's primary means of transportation along the Thames, "legendary for their loud cursing" and their physical strength. They ranged from humble ferryman with small wherries to those who rowed the magnificent barges of nobles and the Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>The 1530s, when Will's story unfolds, were a period of profound religious upheaval. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry VIII</a>'s break with Rome, the dissolution of the monasteries, and the persecution of those who refused the oath of supremacy created an atmosphere of fear and danger. Will's placement at the Charterhouse, a strict Carthusian monastery, occurs just as these religious houses are being pressured to conform to the king's will or face destruction.</p>

<p>The Charterhouse's traditional role of caring for the poor and aged – housing men like Will, feeding the hungry at their doors – exemplifies medieval charity that was being swept away. As the text notes, when the monasteries were dissolved, "suddenly in London now there were tribes of beggars with whom the parishes could scarcely cope." Will is one of the last beneficiaries of this system before it collapses.</p>

<p>Will's participation in the conspiracy to save Father Peter Meredith places him at the dangerous intersection of religious conscience and royal power. His willingness to risk execution for a priest he loves demonstrates that even "simple souls" could be drawn into the deadly politics of the Reformation.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Will Dogget embodies the theme of unexpected redemption. His transformation from a cheerful drunk and "standing joke" into a faithful and courageous servant demonstrates that even those written off by society possess hidden depths of character. His story suggests that what appears to be moral weakness may simply be the absence of the right catalyst – in his case, the companionship and spiritual influence of Father Peter Meredith.</p>

<p>The contrast between Will's "cheerful anarchy" and his later devotion highlights the tension between individual freedom and social responsibility that runs through the book. Will's inability to submit to authority or discipline makes him a burden to his family, yet this same independent spirit becomes profound loyalty when he finally finds someone worthy of his devotion.</p>

<p>Will also represents the "simple souls" whom Thomas Meredith describes as "nobler" than the educated and ambitious. Unlike the courtiers and politicians who calculate their positions on the oath of supremacy based on career and survival, Will's loyalty to Peter is pure and uncomplicated. He participates in a dangerous conspiracy not for gain or from ideology, but because "Peter asked, and the old man loved him."</p>

<p>His story illustrates how ordinary people were affected by the great religious and political upheavals of the Tudor period. Will has no understanding of theology or politics, but he is swept up in events that could lead to his execution simply because of his personal attachment to a priest who followed his conscience.</p>

<p>Finally, Will represents the passing of an old order. The dissolution of the monasteries destroys the system that housed and fed people like him. His departure from the Charterhouse with the disguised Rowland Bull symbolizes the end of medieval charity and the uncertain fate of those who depended on it.</p>
