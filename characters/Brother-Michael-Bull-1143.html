<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Brother Michael Bull is the younger brother of Alderman Sampson Bull who rejects the merchant life of his wealthy family to become a monk at the humble Hospital of St Bartholomew. A pure and contemplative soul, he seeks simplicity and closeness to God, spending over sixty years tending to the sick and poor at Smithfield. His life is marked by quiet devotion, a dramatic rescue of a Jew during the 1189 riot, and an unexpected spiritual crisis involving his nephew David that reveals the complexities of human love and vocation.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Tall and spare, in marked contrast to his thickset older brother. Prayer and meditation softened his broad Saxon face. His head was tonsured as befitted his monastic calling. Despite his religious austerity, he possessed an athletic, well-built physique that was surprisingly strong and perfectly proportioned. In his actions he was quiet and mild, with a wiry frame that remained vigorous even into old age.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Brother Michael embodies genuine spiritual seeking rather than mere religious convention. From youth, he is driven by an inner voice calling him away from the world's emptiness toward purity and simplicity, yearning to feel God's living presence each day. Where his merchant father is coarse and his brother Sampson is blunt and materialistic, Michael is gentle, thoughtful, and devoted to his vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.</p>

<p>He possesses the practical common sense of his Saxon ancestors, which leads him to question the forgeries and excessive worldliness of Westminster Abbey. Yet this same honesty makes him vulnerable to his own unconscious desires. He is capable of spontaneous courage—rescuing Abraham from a mob without hesitation—and of profound kindness, as shown in his decades of devoted care for the sick. His capacity for joy is evident in his vigorous walks and his delight in his nephew's recovery.</p>

<p>However, Michael's purity also renders him dangerously naive about his own heart. He cannot initially see that his devotion to his nephew David and his attraction to Ida are anything other than spiritual love. When Sister Mabel finally forces him to confront the truth about his "unnatural love" for the boy, he experiences devastating self-knowledge that shatters his lifelong confidence in his chastity.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='c-1160-becoming-a-monk'>c. 1160: Becoming a Monk</h3>

<p>At seventeen, Michael announces his desire to become a monk, to his father's disappointment. His father, hoping the proximity to royal power might lead to career advancement, secures him a place in the aristocratic Benedictine community at Westminster Abbey with a handsome donation. Michael passes ten happy years there, loving the peaceful atmosphere, the great hall, and especially the library where he works as a scribe developing a fine hand.</p>

<h3 id='1170-leaving-westminster'>1170: Leaving Westminster</h3>

<p>Two months before the events of the coronation, Michael discovers that at least half the charters in Westminster Abbey are forgeries. When he reports this to the abbot, he is met with laughter and told these fabrications serve God's glory by proving the Abbey's rights and antiquity. Unable to reconcile this with his vows of poverty and honest obedience, and despite being called proud and mad, Michael decides to leave the prestigious monastery for the humble Hospital of St Bartholomew at Smithfield.</p>

<h3 id='september-1170-confrontation-with-sampson'>September 1170: Confrontation with Sampson</h3>

<p>Brother Michael visits St Bartholomew's priory and hospital with his brother Sampson, who has come reluctantly at their mother's urging to be reconciled. The tour goes poorly—Sampson is disgusted by the hospital's sick and suffering inmates. When Michael attempts to save Sampson's soul by warning him against acquiring the Bocton estate from a bankrupt crusader, Sampson declares he doesn't believe in God. <a href="characters/Sister-Mabel-Barnikel-1148.html">Sister Mabel Barnikel</a>, who has been venerating Michael as a saint, angrily rebukes Sampson. The merchant explodes in rage, damning the hospital and monks, and issues a remarkable challenge: if Michael can swear on his deathbed that he has never broken his three monastic vows from that day forward, Sampson will give Bocton to the hospital.</p>

<h3 id='september-3-1189-the-jewish-riot'>September 3, 1189: The Jewish Riot</h3>

<p>On King Richard's coronation day, a riot breaks out when Jews are mistakenly thought to have attacked the king at Westminster. A mob descends on the house of Abraham, the Jewish moneylender who had sold Bocton to Sampson. Brother Michael rushes forward to stand beside the old man, blocking the crowd. When demanded to explain why the Jew should not be killed, Michael—stumped for a moment—remembers that St Bernard of Clairvaux taught that Jews must be preserved so they can eventually be converted. Then, in an act he has never committed before, Michael tells an outright lie: he claims Abraham has already converted. He successfully leads Abraham away from the mob. When Sampson refuses to shelter the Jew in his house for fear it will be burned, it is <a href="characters/Pentecost-Silversleeves-1145.html">Pentecost Silversleeves</a> who pragmatically escorts Abraham to the Tower for protection.</p>

<h3 id='1189-1191-growing-love-for-ida-and-david'>1189-1191: Growing Love for Ida and David</h3>

<p>Following Sampson's marriage to <a href="characters/Ida-Bull-1156.html">Ida Bull</a>, Brother Michael becomes a regular visitor to the merchant's house, dining with the family weekly at Ida's insistence. When young David Bull falls seriously ill in late 1190, Michael visits daily, praying constantly. During the boy's long recovery through early 1191, Michael becomes deeply involved in David's care and education, teaching him Latin and discussing religion. Ida often sits with them, gazing at the monk with adoration. The three form an intense triangle of affection. Though Michael believes his feelings are purely spiritual, he is in fact falling into an unconscious love—both for the pale, noble Ida and for the boy himself. Sister Mabel perceives the danger and tries to warn him about "unnatural love," but Michael dismisses her concerns.</p>

<h3 id='may-1191-the-failed-vocation'>May 1191: The Failed Vocation</h3>

<p>While Sampson and Ida are away at Bocton, Michael, believing he has discerned God's plan, uses his mother's legacy to arrange for both himself and David to enter Westminster Abbey. He convinces the vulnerable, pensive David that he has a vocation for religious life. When the couple returns in June and learns of this plan, Ida reacts with fury, her dreams of David marrying into a noble family shattered. She calls Michael a "meddling old virgin" and orders him from the house. Sampson and Ida, united for once, take David back to Bocton immediately.</p>

<p>When Michael later seeks comfort from Sister Mabel, she bluntly tells him he fell in love with a boy. Michael is initially outraged at this "revolting proposition," but then experiences a devastating realization that it is true. "In his innocence, he had not known." Bent double with shame and pain, he shuffles to his cell like an old man, his lifetime of confidence in his chastity shattered.</p>

<h3 id='1191-1224-final-decades'>1191-1224: Final Decades</h3>

<p>Michael continues his work at St Bartholomew's Hospital. The crisis passes, and in time his relationship with his brother improves. When David is killed by Silversleeves in October 1191 (though his death is attributed to Prince John's knights), Sampson comes to Michael for comfort. The merchant eventually gives generously to St Bartholomew's even without Michael successfully maintaining his vows, showing that brotherly love supersedes the old challenge.</p>

<p>Michael continues his ministry for over three decades more, tended in his final years by the faithful Sister Mabel. He dies very peacefully just before dawn in 1224, around eighty years old. Mabel, praying by his body, sees the green-and-white demon she had long feared would claim him slinking away empty-handed—Brother Michael has been saved despite his human frailties.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='sampson-bull'>Sampson Bull</h3>

<p>Michael's relationship with his older brother is complex and lifelong. In youth, he is shocked by Sampson's "small, blunt cruelties" and revolts against their father's coarseness and obsession with money by entering religious life. The brothers grow estranged when Michael leaves Westminster, and Sampson considers the donations wasted. Their dramatic confrontation at St Bartholomew's in 1170 crystallizes their differences: Sampson the unbelieving, materialistic merchant versus Michael the idealistic monk. Yet Sampson's angry wager—that Michael cannot keep his vows—haunts Michael for decades. After David's death in 1191, the brothers reconcile through shared grief. Sampson eventually supports St Bartholomew's generously even though Michael cannot claim to have kept all his vows, suggesting their bond transcends their religious disputes.</p>

<h3 id='sister-mabel-barnikel'>Sister Mabel Barnikel</h3>

<p>Mabel venerates Michael as a saint from their first meeting in June 1170. She admires his quiet, stately ways, his learning, and most of all his choice to serve at the humble hospital rather than the rich priory. Over the years she becomes protective of him, even fierce in his defense. She alone perceives the spiritual danger when Michael grows too attached to Ida and David, trying to warn him about "unnatural love." Though Michael initially dismisses her concerns, Mabel proves correct, forcing him to confront the truth about himself. In his final years, she tends him lovingly, and after his peaceful death, she sees the demon depart without its prey—vindication of her faith in his ultimate goodness.</p>

<h3 id='ida-bull'>Ida Bull</h3>

<p>Michael is drawn to Ida immediately, admiring her nobility, beauty, and proud spirit. He enjoys their weekly meals together and finds her presence inspiring during David's illness. Her large brown eyes and pale face haunt him, though he does not consciously recognize this as romantic or physical attraction. When she gazes at him "with adoration" while he teaches David, Michael believes this reflects shared spiritual values. Her furious rejection of his plan for David—calling him a "meddling old virgin"—wounds him deeply. Afterward, when Mabel asks if he was in love with Ida, Michael sadly replies, "I don't think I'm in love with her any more," suggesting he had been without knowing it.</p>

<h3 id='david-bull'>David Bull</h3>

<p>Michael's love for his nephew is the great crisis of his monastic life. Initially he is simply a caring uncle, grieving when the boy nearly dies and rejoicing in his recovery. But during their intense months together—praying, studying, walking vigorously through London—Michael develops a passionate attachment he mistakes for spiritual mentorship. When David expresses uncertainty about his life's purpose, Michael seizes on this to arrange their joint entry into Westminster Abbey, planning to be David's guide. He acts "with a heart flowing with love greater than he had ever known before." Sister Mabel's accusation that he "fell in love with a boy" shatters Michael's innocence, forcing him to recognize feelings he had not understood.</p>

<h3 id='abraham'>Abraham</h3>

<p>Michael's rescue of the Jewish moneylender during the 1189 riot is one of his finest moments. Though Abraham is only an acquaintance through the Bocton transaction, Michael does not hesitate to stand between him and the mob. When he cannot immediately remember the theological justification for sparing Jews, Abraham wryly murmurs, "We're waiting, Brother." Michael's desperate lie about Abraham's conversion shows his willingness to compromise his rigid honesty when a life is at stake. Abraham's bitter Jewish joke afterward—"I'm Jewish. I shall never forgive you"—Michael doesn't understand, but it reflects the complex moral reality of being saved by Christian mercy that still regards Jews as needing conversion.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Brother Michael's life spans a period of enormous religious vitality and institutional growth in medieval London. The twelfth and early thirteenth centuries saw a great tide of religious emotion sweeping Europe, with the founding of the Cistercian monasteries, enthusiasm for the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the crusading movement. London experienced this as a proliferation of religious houses—the Knights Templar, Knights of St John, and numerous monasteries and hospitals. By Michael's time, over a fifth of London's population was in religious orders of some kind.</p>

<p>His rejection of Westminster Abbey's forgeries reflects tensions within the medieval Church between worldly power and spiritual purity. The Benedictine order, including Westminster, had become extraordinarily wealthy, accumulating lands and privileges through donations—and sometimes through fabricated documents. The practice of creating false charters to "prove" ancient rights was widespread, especially among Benedictines. Westminster was particularly skilled at this, producing forgeries that would not be detected for centuries. Michael's Saxon common sense rebels against this: "Either it was or it was not an ancient charter. Either he was telling the truth or it was a lie."</p>

<p>His rescue of Abraham during the 1189 riot marks a tragic turning point in English Jewish history. This was England's first major anti-Jewish riot, sparked by misunderstanding and crusading fever. King Richard, preparing for the Third Crusade, had explicitly forbidden Jews from his coronation, creating an atmosphere of suspicion. The doctrine Michael invokes—that Jews must be preserved for eventual conversion—came from Bernard of Clairvaux, the great monastic founder and crusade preacher. This teaching provided theoretical protection for Jewish communities, though in practice it offered little security. The 1189 London riot would be followed by worse atrocities, including the burning of York's Jewish congregation, beginning a century-long erosion of Jewish status in England that would end in their expulsion in 1290.</p>

<p>Michael's crisis over David occurs against the backdrop of the Plantagenet succession struggle. Richard the Lionheart was often absent on crusade, while his brother John maneuvered for power, supported by many barons against Richard's chancellor Longchamp. This political chaos forms the context for David's death in 1191, killed by Silversleeves but attributed to John's knights. That Michael finds comfort in his brother Sampson despite these tragedies reflects how family bonds could transcend even profound ideological differences in this tumultuous period.</p>

<p>By the time of Michael's death in 1224, England had survived King John's disastrous reign and the Magna Carta of 1215. New religious movements were arriving: the Franciscan and Dominican friars, committed to poverty and service rather than institutional wealth. These developments vindicate Michael's early choice to serve at the humble hospital rather than pursue preferment through the powerful Abbey.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Brother Michael embodies the tension between religious idealism and human nature. His life is a meditation on the question: can anyone truly keep monastic vows? His brother Sampson cynically wagers that he cannot, and though Michael serves faithfully for over sixty years, the truth is more complex. He keeps his vow of poverty easily at the humble hospital. His vow of obedience is compromised at Westminster when he cannot obey in good conscience, but this reflects integrity rather than failure. His vow of chastity—maintained physically throughout his life—is nevertheless broken in spirit when he unconsciously falls in love with both Ida and David.</p>

<p>Yet the novel suggests Michael is not damned by this failure. Sister Mabel's vision of the demon slinking away empty-handed indicates that Michael's essential goodness, his decades of compassionate service, and his devastating self-knowledge at the end have saved him. The narrative implies that spiritual purity is not achieved through perfect adherence to rules, but through honesty, service, and ultimately accepting one's flawed humanity.</p>

<p>Michael's rescue of Abraham represents the novel's exploration of religious tolerance and hypocrisy. Medieval Christian doctrine toward Jews was profoundly ambiguous: they were "infidels" who killed Christ, yet also potential converts who must be preserved. Michael embodies this ambiguity—he saves Abraham with genuine courage, but does so by invoking a doctrine that still regards Jews as inferior and incomplete. His unprecedented lie to save a life shows that real moral action sometimes requires breaking one's own rules, a lesson that applies to his monastic vows as well.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Michael's relationship with David explores how love can become dangerous when it is not conscious. Michael's intentions are entirely good: he wants to save his nephew's soul and guide him to God. But because he does not recognize his own emotional and possibly unconscious physical attraction, he makes terrible decisions that hurt everyone involved. The novel suggests that self-deception—even innocent self-deception—can be more spiritually dangerous than acknowledged sin. Mabel, for all her limitations, sees this clearly when she warns about "unnatural love." Michael's moment of agonized recognition is portrayed as a necessary spiritual crisis, painful but ultimately redemptive.</p>

<p>Finally, Michael represents the gradual Saxon absorption into Norman society. Born to a merchant family descended from Saxon landowners who lost their estate at the Conquest, Michael bridges cultures and classes. His common sense is explicitly described as Saxon. Yet he serves in Norman-founded institutions and his education is in the Latin of the international Church. He rescues a Jew, befriends a Norman lady, and spends his life serving all classes at Smithfield. In this sense, he embodies the emerging medieval English identity that would eventually transcend the Conquest's divisions.</p>
