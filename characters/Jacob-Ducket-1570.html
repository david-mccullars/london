<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Sir Jacob Ducket was a wealthy Puritan alderman and Merchant Adventurer who lived through the transition from Elizabeth I to the Stuart kings. A prominent member of the Mercers Company and major investor in colonial ventures, he epitomized the rising Puritan mercantile class that combined religious zeal with commercial ambition. His life was shaped by a deep anxiety about hereditary "curse" of webbed fingers in his family line, his fierce anti-Catholic convictions, and his determination to establish his family as part of London's godly elite. He suffered a debilitating stroke in 1620 and died shortly after King James I in 1625.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Sir Jacob is described in his middle age (around 1611) as walking with dignity through Cheapside: "Dressed in a cloak and tunic of sombre hue, with stockings to match and silver buckled shoes, his neatly pointed grey beard jutting over a perfectly starched white ruff, his hat sporting only a single feather, walking a little stiffly but very erect and carrying a silver-topped stick, Sir Jacob Ducket always looked exactly what he was, a Protestant gentleman."</p>

<p>He bore the distinctive white flash in his hair inherited from his Bull ancestors, but crucially was himself free of the webbed fingers that had marked earlier generations of the Ducket line.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Sir Jacob was a man of rigid Puritan convictions and fierce moral certainty, yet also profoundly anxious about his family's standing and purity. His personality reveals several key traits:</p>

<p><strong>Puritan Zeal</strong>: He was deeply committed to Protestant reform, instilling in his children the mantras "No popery" and unwavering loyalty to the king. He opposed theatres vehemently, moving his household away from Blackfriars when plays were performed there, despite secretly having enjoyed them himself—a weakness he ruthlessly suppressed.</p>

<p><strong>Anxious Perfectionism</strong>: His obsession with the "curse" of webbed fingers reveals deep insecurity about his family's origins. Though descended from the wealthy Silver Ducket and the patrician Bulls, the Ducket line also came from humble origins (a Ducket who "dived into the river" to marry a Bull heiress). He anxiously inspected each of his nine newborn children for webbed fingers, seeing their absence as proof of divine favor. This anxiety combined with Calvinist theology to make him wonder if the deformity was a sign his family might not be among God's elect.</p>

<p><strong>Contradictory Nature</strong>: He believed fervently in humility while being intensely proud. When he told his children "It seems that God has chosen us. Be humble," he really meant "be proud." He crushed his own enjoyment of plays as weakness while profiting from ventures like the Virginia Company that employed theatrical promotional techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Business Acumen</strong>: He was a shrewd Merchant Adventurer with "deep pockets," holding shares in the Levant Company, Muscovy Company, Guinea Company, East India Company, and Virginia Company. He also invested in the ambitious New River Company water supply project.</p>

<p><strong>Moral Rigidity</strong>: He valued his word absolutely, teaching Julius that one's word must be "sacred," even when given to a pirate. Yet this moral absolutism could be harsh—he was prepared to deny Edmund Meredith the parish living based on moral disapproval alone.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='c-1570-birth-and-early-life'>c. 1570: Birth and Early Life</h3>

<p>Jacob Ducket was born into a wealthy London merchant family descended from Silver Ducket (his grandfather), who had acquired a fortune in church plate during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. The Duckets were also descended from the ancient Bull family through a Ducket ancestor who married a Bull heiress. Though proud of the Bull connection, Jacob was troubled to learn that some ancestors had webbed fingers—a hereditary trait he came to view as a possible curse or mark of divine displeasure.</p>

<h3 id='by-1603-rise-to-prominence'>By 1603: Rise to Prominence</h3>

<p>By March 1603, Alderman Ducket had become a successful mercer and established member of London's governing elite. He lived in a handsome five-story house of brick, timber and plaster "just down the lane from St Mary-le-Bow," with three great gables dominating the tiny parish of St Lawrence Silversleeves. He had been married three times, with three children by each wife (nine total), though four had died in infancy.</p>

<h3 id='1603-knighthood-and-juliuss-birth'>1603: Knighthood and Julius's Birth</h3>

<p>When King James I came to the throne in March 1603, Jacob's third wife bore their third son, Julius. Jacob's inspection of the infant confirmed that all nine of his children had been born without webbed fingers—proof to him that "the curse had been lifted" and that God had chosen his family. A month later, when riding out with the mayor to greet the new king, Ducket and his fellow aldermen received knighthood. He was now Sir Jacob Ducket, "bound by sacred fealty to the monarch."</p>

<p>These events confirmed his worldview: God had chosen his family for greatness, and he must raise his children with clear moral precepts. He taught them three essential lessons: loyalty to the king, humble pride in their election by God, and "No popery—the papists are the enemy within."</p>

<h3 id='1605-1611-training-his-sons'>1605-1611: Training His Sons</h3>

<p>Sir Jacob took particular pleasure in training young Julius, who proved an eager pupil. They would walk together from Mary-le-Bow to Cheapside, first visiting the Mercers' Hall, then to Julius's favorite destination: the Royal Exchange. There Sir Jacob conducted his business as a Merchant Adventurer, holding shares in all the major trading companies. He taught Julius about these ventures, reading to him from Hakluyt's <i>Voyages</i> and discussing the Virginia Company's colonial ambitions.</p>

<p>When Julius discovered a pirate's treasure chest in the cellar (belonging to the absent Black Barnikel), Sir Jacob used it to teach a crucial lesson: one's word must be sacred, even when given to a pirate who deserves hanging. He also showed Julius the New River Company project, in which he was a proud investor.</p>

<p>His elder son Henry had gone to Oxford at sixteen, then spent years in Italy and Paris, returning in 1616 as a sophisticated, aristocratic figure who would help manage the family business.</p>

<h3 id='1611-1615-parish-leadership-and-conflicts'>1611-1615: Parish Leadership and Conflicts</h3>

<p>As a leading vestryman of St Lawrence Silversleeves parish (effectively controlling it with a draper and an elderly silent colleague), Sir Jacob exercised significant authority. He disapproved strongly of Edmund Meredith, the playwright-turned-clergyman, but was outmaneuvered in 1615 when Meredith sought the parish living. Though Sir Jacob tried to reject him for moral failings, young Julius's innocent question about the king's support forced Sir Jacob to accept Meredith as vicar.</p>

<p>Sir Jacob also supported the Virginia Company's promotional efforts, approving Meredith's sermon to promote Pocahontas's 1616 visit to London.</p>

<h3 id='1616-the-discovery-of-the-doggets'>1616: The Discovery of the Doggets</h3>

<p>After Pocahontas's appearance, Julius encountered Martha Carpenter's new family (she had married the boatbuilder John Dogget). Julius reported to his father that Dogget and his children bore both the white flash of hair and webbed fingers characteristic of the Ducket line. This revelation devastated Sir Jacob. He realized these Doggets must be descended from the foundling—"the orphan; the gutter child"—some distant relative who had introduced polluted blood into the family line.</p>

<p>The discovery shattered his confidence that the curse had been lifted. "As he stared with loathing, it was not his son that he saw, but a horrifying vision—as though the ground under his feet had opened up to reveal a whole world of subterranean cellars, pits and passages, the dark corrupted ventricles of his own ancestry from which who knew what horrors might worm their way up into daylight to confront him." He muttered "The curse" and forbade Julius to go near "those people." The next day he began making secret inquiries about the Southwark family.</p>

<h3 id='1620-the-stroke'>1620: The Stroke</h3>

<p>Seeking to rid himself of the cursed Dogget family, Sir Jacob anonymously paid them a handsome sum (through a third party) to join the <i>Mayflower</i> expedition to America. However, when the <i>Speedwell</i> proved unseaworthy and the Doggets returned to London, taking up residence with Carpenter in his own parish, the blow was crushing.</p>

<p>In October 1620, after Julius informed him the Doggets had returned, Sir Jacob sat alone for hours with a flagon of wine—"a thing he never normally did"—and suffered a severe stroke. His right side was paralyzed and he lost the ability to speak. His two sons, Henry and Julius, immediately took over management of his affairs.</p>

<h3 id='1620-1625-final-years'>1620-1625: Final Years</h3>

<p>Sir Jacob never recovered from his stroke, remaining paralyzed and mute. Henry showed courage in how he handled their father's condition: once a week, "immaculately dressed and followed by his two sons, Sir Jacob was carried in a litter to the Royal Exchange so that people could pay their respects to him."</p>

<p>When the Doggets attended required Sunday services at St Lawrence Silversleeves, Sir Jacob "would gaze across the little church at the cursed family with impotent loathing—imprisoned both by the stroke that paralysed him and the fact that, even if he could speak and demand his money back, sooner or later people would ask the reason why he had lent it to them."</p>

<h3 id='c-1624-baronetcy'>c. 1624: Baronetcy</h3>

<p>Despite his incapacity, Henry arranged for his father to be created a baronet, purchasing the hereditary title for £1,200. This was one of the Stuarts' innovations: a baronetcy allowed the holder and his heirs to style themselves "Sir" in perpetuity, without sitting in the House of Lords. Henry secured this honor to provide ultimate proof "of the purity of his family's blood."</p>

<h3 id='c-1625-death'>c. 1625: Death</h3>

<p>"A year later, old King James departed life and Sir Jacob followed him soon after; but, if such proof were needed of the purity of his family's blood, he died a hereditary noble." His son Henry became Sir Henry Ducket, 2nd Baronet.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='julius-ducketjulius-ducket-1603html'><a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Julius Ducket</a></h3>

<p>Sir Jacob doted on his youngest son Julius, who proved an ideal pupil for his father's lessons. From age four, Julius would boisterously cry "No popery" and "God save the king," which amused even the stern Sir Jacob. He took Julius regularly to the Mercers' Hall and Royal Exchange, training him in business and instilling Puritan values. Their relationship was warm and trusting until Julius's innocent report about the Doggets' webbed fingers traumatized Sir Jacob, though Julius never fully understood why his father reacted so violently.</p>

<h3 id='henry-duckethenry-ducket-1600html'><a href="characters/Henry-Ducket-1600.html">Henry Ducket</a></h3>

<p>Sir Jacob's relationship with his elder son was more distant. Henry had been "lazy" as a youth and spent years abroad in Italy and Paris rather than returning to London. However, when Henry returned in 1616, he proved invaluable in managing the family business after Sir Jacob's stroke. Henry showed filial devotion by ensuring his paralyzed father was regularly displayed at the Royal Exchange to maintain the family's dignity. The baronetcy Henry secured for his father just before his death was a final demonstration of his commitment to the family's honor.</p>

<h3 id='the-dogget-family'>The Dogget Family</h3>

<p>Sir Jacob never knew the Doggets before 1616, but their existence became a source of horror to him. The humble Southwark boatbuilders bore the physical markers of Ducket ancestry (white hair flash and webbed fingers), revealing that the family's "curse" had not been eradicated but merely survived in a lower-class branch. His desperate attempt to pay them to emigrate to America, and their unexpected return, directly triggered his stroke. In his final paralyzed years, being forced to see them at church services was a weekly torment.</p>

<h3 id='martha-carpentermartha-carpenter-1584html'><a href="characters/Martha-Carpenter-1584.html">Martha Carpenter</a></h3>

<p>Martha had been a respected member of his parish's Puritan community, but her marriage to John Dogget and return to the parish after the failed <i>Mayflower</i> voyage made her part of the family Sir Jacob considered cursed.</p>

<h3 id='edmund-meredithedmund-meredith-1575html'><a href="characters/Edmund-Meredith-1575.html">Edmund Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Sir Jacob strongly disapproved of Meredith as a frivolous playwright and suspected womanizer. He attempted to deny him the parish living in 1615 but was outmaneuvered. Later, however, he was pleased with Meredith's promotional sermon for the Virginia Company in 1616 and apparently accepted his role as vicar, at least professionally.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Sir Jacob Ducket embodied the Puritan merchant class that rose to prominence in Elizabethan and early Stuart London. His life reflected several major historical currents:</p>

<p><strong>The Merchant Adventurers and Colonial Expansion</strong>: As a major investor in trading companies and colonial ventures like Virginia and Ulster, Sir Jacob represented London's aggressive commercial expansion. These joint-stock companies pioneered modern capitalism, and his belief that Virginia should be "the Ulster of America"—a Protestant plantation civilizing "wild papists" and "heathen Indians"—captured the colonial mindset of his era.</p>

<p><strong>Puritan Religion and Politics</strong>: His fierce anti-Catholicism ("No popery"), his opposition to theatres, and his Calvinist anxiety about election and predestination were typical of London's Puritan elite. His conviction that "God has chosen us" reflected the Puritan belief in a godly elect who would build the "shining city on a hill." His loyalty to the king, even as James I disappointed Puritan hopes for further reform, showed the tension Puritans felt between religious conviction and political obedience.</p>

<p><strong>The Tudor-Stuart Transition</strong>: Sir Jacob benefited from the shift to Stuart rule, receiving knighthood in 1603 and later a baronetcy. Yet his final years coincided with growing tensions between Charles I's belief in Divine Right and Parliamentary opposition—tensions that would soon explode into civil war.</p>

<p><strong>Social Mobility and Anxiety</strong>: Though wealthy and powerful, Sir Jacob's obsession with the "curse" revealed anxieties about social legitimacy. The Duckets had risen from humble origins (a diver who married an heiress) to wealth (Silver Ducket's acquisition of monastic plate) to the aldermanic elite. Yet physical markers of their lowly past—webbed fingers inherited from their founding ancestor—haunted them. Sir Jacob's horror at discovering the Doggets showed how precarious he felt his family's position was, despite all their success.</p>

<p><strong>The New River Company</strong>: His investment in Sir Hugh Myddelton's ambitious water supply project illustrated London's infrastructure challenges and the entrepreneurial solutions of the era. The New River brought fresh water from springs twenty miles north, with royal backing and monopoly privileges that Sir Jacob supported: "You need a monopoly to make these huge investments possible."</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Sir Jacob Ducket represents several key themes in Rutherford's <i>London</i>:</p>

<p><strong>Heredity, Legitimacy, and the Past</strong>: His story powerfully illustrates how families cannot escape their origins, no matter how much wealth or status they acquire. The webbed fingers that haunted the Ducket line symbolize the indelible marks of ancestry. Jacob's conviction that he had "cleansed" his bloodline proved illusory—the Doggets revealed that the "polluted stream" still flowed. His life demonstrates that in a society obsessed with blood and lineage, social anxiety never fully disappears.</p>

<p><strong>Puritan Contradiction</strong>: Sir Jacob embodies the contradictions of Puritan culture: preaching humility while being intensely proud, condemning pleasure while pursuing profit, claiming moral purity while being anxiously insecure. His secret enjoyment of plays, ruthlessly suppressed, shows the human cost of Puritan self-denial.</p>

<p><strong>The Rise of Capitalism</strong>: As a Merchant Adventurer investing in trading companies, colonial ventures, and infrastructure projects, Sir Jacob represents the emergence of modern capitalism. His belief that commercial enterprise could serve God—that one could "serve God in the Royal Exchange as well as in the church"—showed how Puritanism's work ethic sanctified profit-making.</p>

<p><strong>Divine Right and Authority</strong>: His absolute loyalty to the monarchy, even when kings disappointed Puritan hopes, reflected the era's belief in ordained hierarchy. Yet his son Julius would eventually question the legitimacy of unelected authority (like the self-perpetuating vestry), foreshadowing the constitutional conflicts that would tear Stuart England apart.</p>

<p><strong>Disability and Power</strong>: Sir Jacob's final years, paralyzed and speechless yet still carried to the Royal Exchange for public display, illustrate how power and dignity could be maintained through family solidarity and social performance, even when personal agency was lost.</p>
