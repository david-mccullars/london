<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Eugene Penny is a French Huguenot watchmaker who fled religious persecution, first arriving in London in 1666 during the Great Fire. Born Eugene de la Penissière, he adopted the anglicized surname "Penny" at the suggestion of <a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful Carpenter</a> who saved him from a mob. His life story traces the broader fate of the Huguenots in late 17th-century Europe – torn between homeland and safety, experiencing persecution in France, and ultimately finding refuge in Protestant England.</p>

<h2 id='physical-description'>Physical Description</h2>

<p>Eugene is described as a slim, intelligent-looking young man with fine brown hair. His most distinctive feature is the pair of spectacles he wears, through which he peers short-sightedly. By his mid-twenties, his face became thinner and finely chiselled, with deep, lustrous brown eyes. <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a> thinks he might almost be Spanish in appearance. He has a nervous habit of taking off his spectacles and polishing them when embarrassed.</p>

<h2 id='character-and-personality'>Character and Personality</h2>

<p>Eugene is characterized by caution and careful planning, traits he shares with his father. He is persistent and skilled in his craft as a watchmaker, eventually earning a position with the renowned London clockmaker Thomas Tompion. Despite his practical abilities, he is deeply sentimental and prone to homesickness, which proves nearly fatal to his family.</p>

<p>His personality reflects the divided loyalties of the Huguenot experience. Though he recognizes danger intellectually – understanding persecution when he sees it – his emotional attachment to France repeatedly clouds his judgment. He is respectful of authority and deferential in manner, addressing others as "sir" and "Monsieur." His accent marks him as foreign, and he speaks French naturally, using expressions like "Oui," "Non," and "Alors."</p>

<p>Eugene possesses political insight born of bitter experience. Having lived through French persecution, he immediately recognizes the pattern when he sees Catholic dragoons in England, understanding what the English, who have never experienced such oppression, fail to see. This gives him a certain tragic prescience – he can identify the trap that others walk into blindly.</p>

<h2 id='life-and-events'>Life and Events</h2>

<h3 id='1666-arrival-in-london'>1666: Arrival in London</h3>

<p>Eugene arrives in London on the day after the Great Fire begins, coming to live with his uncle in the French Protestant community near the Savoy. On his second day in England, as the fire rages, he is attacked by a mob of youths who suspect all foreigners of starting the blaze. Though he protests that he is Protestant – a Huguenot, not a Catholic – his foreign accent and appearance make him a target.</p>

<p><a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful Carpenter</a> intervenes, standing before the boy and declaring his own Puritan credentials and Eugene's Protestant faith. When the mob disperses, Eugene walks with his rescuer back to the Savoy. During this walk, Carpenter struggles with Eugene's French surname, de la Penissière, finding it impossible to remember or pronounce. He suggests the English equivalent "Penny," which Eugene gratefully accepts, saying: "You saved my life, sir. You are a very brave man. If you say I should be called Penny. Alors, Penny."</p>

<p>Eugene reveals that he is a watchmaker by trade and promises they will meet again. Before parting, he expresses his conviction that the Great Fire was indeed started by Catholics, showing his deep suspicion of Catholic power even at this young age.</p>

<h3 id='1675-homesickness-and-the-return-to-france'>1675: Homesickness and the Return to France</h3>

<p>Nearly a decade later, Eugene has established himself in London as a skilled watchmaker, gaining a position with the great Thomas Tompion. He meets <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a>, now an ordained clergyman, at the opening of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, where Tompion is installing a timepiece.</p>

<p>Despite his professional success, Eugene is overcome by terrible homesickness. His family in France has come to no harm, and he increasingly feels his exile is unnecessary. When he confesses to Meredith his desire to return home, the clergyman thinks him mad and advises him to at least write to his father for permission. Eugene, however, seems unlikely to heed this advice.</p>

<h3 id='1675-1685-life-in-france'>1675-1685: Life in France</h3>

<p>Eugene returns to France against his father's wishes. His father had sent him to England with a specific purpose: "The kings of France have sworn, by the Treaty of Nantes, to allow us to worship freely in perpetuity. But the Church of Rome is strong; the king is devout. Go to England therefore. If we are sure we are safe here, you can return. If not, you must prepare a new home for your brothers and sisters there."</p>

<p>His father is furious at Eugene's return and refuses to speak to him for a year. The rift only begins to heal when Eugene marries a Huguenot girl whose father is a shipper at Bordeaux. When his father dies five years later (c. 1680), Eugene becomes head of the family. His troubles multiply when his father's young widow converts to Catholicism and marries a Catholic with a small vineyard, leaving Eugene responsible not only for his own two young daughters but also for his unmarried half-sister who refuses to convert.</p>

<h3 id='1685-the-dragoons'>1685: The Dragoons</h3>

<p>In 1685, persecution intensifies dramatically. King Louis XIV quarters dragoons on Huguenot households as a method of forced conversion. Eugene experiences this terror firsthand when dragoons arrive at his home, commanded by an officer of cool insolence. The soldiers shake nuts from trees, slaughter a pig with sabres, and demand all three bedrooms, forcing Eugene, his wife, and two daughters to sleep in the barn.</p>

<p>The officer informs them of the girls' ages with particular interest – any Huguenot child over seven can be converted without parental consent. Eugene realizes that within a year or two, his daughters will face this fate. He deeply regrets not staying in London.</p>

<p>That autumn brings the ultimate crisis: the Edict of Nantes is revoked entirely. All Huguenot pastors are banished on pain of execution. All Huguenots are forbidden to leave France, and all their children must become Catholic. That night, at nearly midnight, Eugene wakes his children and tells them: "Wrap up as warm as you can and put on your boots. We're leaving."</p>

<h3 id='1685-escape-from-bordeaux'>1685: Escape from Bordeaux</h3>

<p>Eugene takes his family to his father-in-law, the Bordeaux shipper, who risks his own life to help them escape. The merchant, however, cannot leave himself – with five children still to care for and his entire business tied to France, he must convert to Catholicism and stay, though it causes him great grief.</p>

<p>The escape plan involves hiding Eugene, his wife, and their two daughters in barrels aboard an English ship. Tiny air holes are drilled in the tops of the casks, and each person is given a flagon of water and two loaves of bread, with stern warnings to ration carefully as they may be trapped inside for days. The five barrels are stacked among a hundred others in the center of the cargo.</p>

<p>The escape nearly ends in disaster. When the English captain opens Eugene's barrel at sea, he cheerfully informs him that an officer stuck his sword right through the barrel next to his – which fortunately contained only wine. The family reaches Bristol safely, joining the swelling Huguenot community there.</p>

<h3 id='1686-1688-bristol-and-return-to-london'>1686-1688: Bristol and Return to London</h3>

<p>Eugene settles in Bristol and finds work as a watchmaker, prospering modestly. However, he misses working for Tompion. After nearly a year in Bristol, disturbing news begins to reach him: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King James II</a> is appointing Catholics to the army and Privy Council, granting them tolerance, and attempting to turn an Oxford college into a Catholic seminary.</p>

<p>While the English accept these developments phlegmatically, Eugene and other Huguenots find them deeply ominous. "We were protected once, by the Treaty of Nantes," Eugene remarks. "And look what happened to that." In spring 1688, when James announces a Declaration of Indulgence to be read in churches, Eugene remains skeptical.</p>

<p>He travels to London to seek his old position with Tompion, finding his friend <a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful Carpenter</a> and discovering, to his astonishment, that the woodcarver now supports the Catholic king. Carpenter explains that James has granted unprecedented tolerance to Dissenters, allowing them to join livery companies and hold office. Even the Lord Mayor is a Baptist. But Eugene cannot share this optimism.</p>

<h3 id='1688-recognition-of-danger'>1688: Recognition of Danger</h3>

<p>Walking near Whitehall, Eugene watches the Coldstream Guards exercising and the Life Guards cavalry passing by. An elderly gentleman remarks on the large camp of soldiers under Catholic officers ten miles outside London. In that moment, Eugene understands with sickening clarity what the English cannot see: "He had seen dragoons like this before and he knew what they could do."</p>

<p>He realizes that King James, like King Louis of France, is setting a trap – using tolerance and liberal policies to gain power, then preparing military force to impose Catholicism. That night he argues unsuccessfully with Carpenter, and the next day he seeks out <a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a>, telling him sternly: "It's a trap."</p>

<p>Meredith, more cynical and better informed, reassures him. The clergyman knows that James is in poor health and has contracted venereal disease, making the chances of a healthy male heir remote. "England will stay Protestant," he promises Eugene. "Even with dragoons, he can't impose Catholicism by force. You're safe. I promise."</p>

<h3 id='1688-and-beyond-the-glorious-revolution'>1688 and Beyond: The Glorious Revolution</h3>

<p>Eugene's fears prove both right and wrong. When James's wife produces a son – widely suspected to be smuggled in via a warming pan – the nation turns against the king. <a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful Carpenter</a> travels to Holland with the elderly <a href="characters/Julius-Ducket-1603.html">Lord St James</a> to meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William of Orange</a>, and the Glorious Revolution follows. The Catholic threat is ended permanently.</p>

<p>Eugene's recognition of the danger was accurate, but the English political system proved resilient enough to reject Catholic rule peacefully. The Huguenots like the Penny family are now guaranteed safety in Protestant England, allied with the Dutch under a Calvinist king whose greatest enemy is Louis XIV of France.</p>

<h3 id='1695-return-to-tompion'>1695: Return to Tompion</h3>

<p>A month after Meredith's son is born in 1695, Eugene visits the clergyman with a gift – a handsome silver watch containing Tompion's latest innovation, the cylinder escapement. This mechanism allows all the watch's cog wheels to be arranged horizontally, making it flat enough to slip into a pocket. "It's the neatest thing I ever saw in my life," Meredith exclaims.</p>

<p>The gift celebrates both the birth and Eugene's gratitude for Meredith's help in securing his position back with Tompion, the master clockmaker of London. Eugene has finally achieved what he sought – a return to the finest workshop in the city, now in a land where he and his family can live and worship in safety.</p>

<h2 id='relationships'>Relationships</h2>

<h3 id='o-be-joyful-carpentero-be-joyful-carpenter-1636html'><a href="characters/O-Be-Joyful-Carpenter-1636.html">O Be Joyful Carpenter</a></h3>

<p>Carpenter saves Eugene's life during the Great Fire, rescuing him from a mob and giving him his anglicized name. Eugene calls him "a very brave man" and promises they will meet again. Twenty-two years later, when Eugene returns to London from Bristol, he seeks out his old friend and stays with him. Their relationship reveals the political divide of 1688 – Eugene, having experienced French persecution, immediately recognizes the danger of Catholic absolutism, while Carpenter, enjoying new tolerances granted to Dissenters, is willing to support James II. Eugene tries unsuccessfully to warn him that it's a trap, showing how their different experiences shape their understanding of the same political moment.</p>

<h3 id='richard-meredithrichard-meredith-1640html'><a href="characters/Richard-Meredith-1640.html">Richard Meredith</a></h3>

<p>Meredith becomes Eugene's patron and friend, first meeting him through Carpenter. The clergyman helps Eugene secure his position with Tompion and later, after Eugene's disastrous return to France and second flight to England, helps him regain that position. Their relationship shows the protective attitude educated Englishmen often took toward the persecuted Huguenots. Meredith thinks Eugene "mad" for wanting to return to France in 1675, and later reassures him about English political stability with perhaps more confidence than is warranted. Eugene shows his gratitude in 1695 with the gift of one of Tompion's finest watches.</p>

<h3 id='his-father'>His Father</h3>

<p>Eugene's relationship with his father is defined by a mission betrayed. His father sent him to England with clear instructions: prepare a refuge for the family if France becomes unsafe. When Eugene returns home out of homesickness, his father refuses to speak to him for a year. This paternal wisdom proves tragically correct – five years after they reconcile, the father dies, and shortly afterward the revocation of the Edict of Nantes forces Eugene to flee France anyway, this time with his own family in tow, having lost years and nearly his children's lives through his earlier sentimentality.</p>

<h3 id='thomas-tompion'>Thomas Tompion</h3>

<p>Though Tompion appears only indirectly in the narrative, Eugene's relationship with this master clockmaker is central to his professional identity. Eugene is so devoted to working for Tompion that he returns from Bristol to London specifically to seek re-employment, even after Tompion initially refuses him for having left before. Eugene's pride in the cylinder escapement watch he gives Meredith reflects his deep respect for his master's genius and his own skill in executing Tompion's designs.</p>

<h2 id='historical-context'>Historical Context</h2>

<p>Eugene Penny's life embodies the Huguenot experience in late 17th-century Europe. The Huguenots were French Calvinists who, despite protection under the 1598 Edict of Nantes, faced increasing restrictions and persecution as Louis XIV sought to impose Catholic uniformity on France. The gradual tightening of restrictions – special taxes, forbidden marriages with Catholics, forced conversion of children over seven – paralleled tactics used in other European religious conflicts.</p>

<p>The quartering of dragoons on Huguenot families, which Eugene experiences in 1685, was a particularly brutal method of forced conversion. These troops would occupy homes, consume family stores, terrorize inhabitants, and make life so unbearable that many Huguenots converted rather than endure the persecution. The policy, called <i>dragonnades</i>, was technically legal while remaining barbaric.</p>

<p>The 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which Louis XIV declared would drive all Huguenots back to Catholicism, instead triggered one of the largest refugee crises in European history. Some 200,000 Huguenots fled France despite prohibitions against emigration, bringing valuable skills to Protestant nations. England received scores of thousands, eventually creating such demographic impact that three out of every four Englishmen would have Huguenot ancestry.</p>

<p>These refugees arrived at a crucial moment in English history. The reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James II</a> (1685-1688) saw a Catholic monarch attempting to increase Catholic power and toleration, alarming Protestant England. Eugene's immediate recognition of danger in English dragoons reflects his recent trauma in France – he sees patterns the English, who have never experienced such persecution, cannot yet perceive.</p>

<p>The Glorious Revolution of 1688 permanently secured England as a Protestant refuge. The settlement banned Catholics from the throne and ensured Huguenots like Eugene could live and work in safety. English and Dutch Protestants, united under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William III</a>, would spend the next century opposing Louis XIV's Catholic absolutism in a series of European wars.</p>

<p>Eugene's profession as a watchmaker places him in one of the era's most sophisticated crafts. London watchmaking reached its zenith in this period, with Thomas Tompion (c. 1639-1713) recognized as the finest clockmaker in Europe. Huguenot craftsmen like Eugene contributed significantly to this excellence, bringing Continental techniques that helped make English watches pre-eminent. The cylinder escapement mechanism Eugene presents to Meredith in 1695 represents a genuine advance in horology, allowing the creation of the flat pocket watch.</p>

<h2 id='themes-and-significance'>Themes and Significance</h2>

<p>Eugene Penny represents the tragedy of exile and the wisdom that comes from suffering. His story illustrates how persecution creates insight – having experienced French Catholic absolutism, he immediately recognizes its warning signs in England, while the English themselves remain blind to the danger. This gives him a kind of tragic prescience; he can see the trap being set, but cannot convince others until events prove him right.</p>

<p>His character explores the tension between homeland and safety. Eugene's homesickness in the 1670s, when France seems stable and the Treaty of Nantes still protects Huguenots, leads him to make a near-fatal mistake. His father's fury at his return reflects the older generation's understanding that treaties and promises mean nothing when power shifts. By the time Eugene flees France a second time, he has lost years and nearly lost his daughters, learning through bitter experience what his father tried to tell him: sometimes exile is not optional.</p>

<p>The name change from de la Penissière to Penny symbolizes the immigrant experience of transformation and adaptation. Eugene accepts this anglicization gratefully, recognizing that survival in England requires becoming, in some measure, English. Yet he never fully loses his French identity – his accent, his memories of persecution, and his understanding of Catholic absolutism remain distinctly French. He becomes a hyphenated person, French-English, carrying memories that make him perpetually foreign while building a life that makes him increasingly native.</p>

<p>Eugene's story connects to the book's larger themes about the making of London through waves of immigration. Just as his Huguenot descendants will spread through English society, contributing skills and eventually ancestry to three-quarters of English families, so too have earlier waves of refugees and immigrants – Roman, Saxon, Norman, Flemish – shaped the city. London's greatness derives partly from its role as a refuge, and the Huguenots represent perhaps the most successful example of this pattern.</p>

<p>Finally, Eugene embodies the craftsman's contribution to English excellence. His work with Tompion on the cylinder escapement is not merely personal achievement but part of England's rise to technological and commercial pre-eminence. The Huguenot refugees brought Continental sophistication in watchmaking, silk-weaving, and other crafts that helped make 18th-century London a center of European craftsmanship and commerce. Eugene's small watch, slipping into a pocket, represents the precision and ingenuity that would characterize the coming age.</p>
